# University of Magallanes Thesis R Markdown Template

A comprehensive R Markdown template for Honours, Master's, and PhD theses at the University of Magallanes, specifically designed for the Antarctic and SubAntarctic Science doctoral program.

## Overview

This repository provides a complete thesis template using R Markdown with the `bookdown` package. The template is adapted from the [unofficial University of Toronto R Markdown thesis template](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/academic-progress/program-completion/formatting/) developed by Francois Pitt, and has been customized for the University of Magallanes requirements.

## Key Features

- **Institutional Customization**: Tailored for University of Magallanes branding and formatting requirements
- **Flexible Metadata**: Customizable school/department, university, country, and logo through YAML configuration
- **Academic Structure**: Support for director and co-directors (thesis supervisors)
- **Multi-format Output**: Primary focus on PDF generation with LaTeX backend
- **Chapter Management**: Support for both R Markdown and LaTeX chapters
- **Reproducible Research**: Integrated code execution and dynamic document generation

## Differences from Toronto Template

While largely based on the Toronto template, this version includes:

- University of Magallanes-specific formatting and styling
- Customizable institutional metadata (school, department, country, logo)
- Enhanced PDF metadata fields (subject and keywords)
- Support for thesis director and co-directors
- Adapted citation and bibliography styles for Antarctic research

## Customization

### Basic Configuration

Edit the YAML header in `index.Rmd`:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Thesis Title"
author: "Your Name"
date: "Submission Date"
university: "University of Magallanes"
school: "Graduate School"
department: "Antarctic and SubAntarctic Science Program"
director: "Dr. Director Name"
codirector: "Dr. Co-director Name"
country: "Chile"
logo: "path/to/logo.png"
keywords: "Antarctic, marine ecology, krill"
subject: "Antarctic Science"
---
```

### Advanced Customization

- **LaTeX Styling**: Modify `ut-thesis.cls` and `ut-thesis.tex`
- **Chapter Organization**: Edit `_bookdown.yml` to add/remove chapters
- **Output Formats**: Adjust `_output.yml` for different output options
- **Bibliography**: Update `references.bib` with your citations

## Writing Your Thesis

### Adding Chapters

1. Create new `.Rmd` files in the root directory
2. Name them with number prefixes (e.g., `03-methods.Rmd`)
3. Update `_bookdown.yml` to include new chapters

### Including Figures and Tables

```r
# For figures
knitr::include_graphics("figures/my-figure.png")

# For tables
knitr::kable(my_data, caption = "My Table")
```

### Citations and References

Use standard R Markdown citation syntax:
```markdown
[@author2023] or @author2023
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **LaTeX Errors**: Ensure all required LaTeX packages are installed
2. **Package Dependencies**: Run `install.packages()` for missing packages
3. **File Paths**: Use relative paths for figures and data files
4. **Encoding Issues**: Ensure all files are saved in UTF-8 encoding
