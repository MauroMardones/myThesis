In recent decades, evidence of changes in climatic and oceanographic variables has been demonstrated with profuse scientific evidence which has been well compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@IPCC2014]. The impact of these changes has resulted in perturbations in structure and functioning of ecosystems and have been associated with anthropogenic action [@Marshall2018] [@Worm2012] and related to global Climate Change (CC) [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Rijnsdorp2009] [@Arana2020b; @Arcos2004; @Worm2012].

A driver is defined as any natural or anthropogenic factor that causes direct or indirect changes in an ecosystem. A direct driver has unequivocal influence on ecosystem processes, while an indirect driver operates diffusely, by altering one or more drivers. In marine populations, direct drivers have impact on physiology and phenological aspects, and indirect drivers have impact on primary productivity or ecological interactions, spatial distribution or larval transport [@Koenigstein2016].

In all oceans of the world, marine populations are evidencing the effects of CC, either by the sum and/or combination of CC drivers, and on which there exists solid scientific evidence that demonstrates the effects on responses such as physiology, ecology and observable variables such as distribution, biomass and productivity at local and global scales [@Barange2014; @Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Perry2005; @Rijnsdorp2009]. These new external conditions are producing impacts on marine ecosystems through changes in habitats [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Shoji2011; @Rijnsdorp2009; @Hidalgo2018], which has effects on population sustainability and in turn, on associated socio-ecological systems.

There is multiple evidence that demonstrates and quantifies the impact of CC on different groups of marine species, whether these are mammals, fish, mollusks and diverse organisms that constitute ecological communities in different ecosystems of the planet. Some authors propose that the impacts of CC, through warming of water masses, would trigger changes in spatial distribution patterns of marine organisms making them migrate toward high latitudes [@Cheung2010a; @Kortsch2015; @Melbourne-Thomas2021]. In this sense, it is necessary to understand how these environmental drivers will impact high-latitude ecosystems such as, for example, the Southern Ocean (SO), and therefore, how marine species that inhabit there will respond. In that sense, polar regions must be analyzed in light of scientific evidence, identifying the changes that have occurred, as well as projecting the impacts of CC on these populations.

The Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica is a critical component of the terrestrial system, and sustains a marine ecosystem of immense ecological, economic and intrinsic value. This ocean is spatially defined based on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which transports the most water in the entire ocean. This current formed 34 million years ago flows almost freely from west to east around the Antarctic continent, in a fluctuating band that is located approximately at 60° south latitude. At this point the water is colder and less salty than in adjacent oceans. For all these characteristics, this ocean is one of the most sensitive areas to CC. The key drivers and their influence on key processes within the SO have already experienced changes in their attributes, among them can be identified: ocean temperature, sea ice dynamics, stratification, currents, among others [@Sylvester2021; @Morley2020].

In the SO inhabit species that make up the largest marine populations on the planet, among them krill *Euphausia superba* and demersal fish such as Antarctic cod *Dissostichus mawsoni* [@Atkinson2009; @Veytia2020; @Pinones2016]. These two species are essential in the Southern Ocean, given that they form structural part of the trophic and ecological web [@Pinones2016; @Atkinson2009]. On the other hand, these populations are intensively exploited by the fishing industry for more than 50 years, constituting a very important economic activity. In this sense, any impact that the different environmental drivers have on the productivity of these marine species raises multiple interests, ranging from scientific to economic.

Understanding then what are and how the main drivers act and their impact on population processes of the most important species that inhabit the SO and how these species will respond to this influence is fundamental to understand and anticipate some climate scenario. The objective therefore is to identify the influence of CC through environmental drivers on the most important marine populations of the Southern Ocean.


Any perception of a marine environment without changes is today a naive and biased statement. This view is easily contradicted by observing the dramatic evidence of changes in structure, abundance and distribution of species across the temporal scale from years, decades, centuries and millennia [@Pinsky2020]. In this sense, it is important to determine which environmental drivers are producing changes at the population level. This type of studies have been abundant in recent times given the importance of the SO and the populations that inhabit there in a context of accelerated CC.

[@Morley2020] have classified the most important and most influential drivers in the SO, which are classified as physical, anthropogenic and biological drivers. Among physical drivers, global warming, atmospheric-oceanographic processes and marine currents can be identified.

Regarding drivers associated with global warming that have impact on marine populations, the factors with most evidence are temperature and dissolved oxygen. These two drivers are the main responsible for controlling aerobic metabolism of ectothermic organisms such as fish and crustaceans, and are also the two environmental variables most generally influenced by anthropogenic climate change [@Duncan2020].

## Temperature

Temperature regulates the rate of aerobic metabolism through energy consumption for physiological processes, a process accelerated when the organism is subjected to high temperatures. In this sense, it should be noted that the ocean has warmed incessantly since 2005, showing clear well-documented trends in the 5th IPCC Assessment Report [@IPCC2014]. The warming trend is confirmed by ocean temperature measurements during the last decade. Depths of 0-700 m. and 700-2000 m. of the ocean have warmed at rates of 5.31 ± 0.48 and 4.02 ± 0.97 g° year-1 from 2005 to 2017. The long-term trend for depths of 0-700 m. and 700-2000 m. have warmed 4.35 ± 0.8 and 2.25 ± 0.64 g° year-1 between 1971-1990 and 1998-2017 respectively. It is likely that ocean warming has continued in the abyssal and deep ocean below 2000 m (southern hemisphere and southern ocean) [@Bindoff2019].

With respect to temperature and its future variations, [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019] made predictions through fish biomass simulations in different oceans through ensemble models, and different results were identified facing the same environmental variable, which in this case was Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability  (Figure \@ref(fig:temp)).

```

It should be noted according to this analysis, that in the great majority of oceans, the relationship between SST increase and biomass changes were inversely proportional, except for the Southern and Arctic oceans, where temperature changes would benefit marine populations of those ecosystems. These results coincide with what was proposed by [@Koenigstein2016], who pointed to benefits in marine populations of high-latitude ecosystems due to the effect of CC and global warming.

@Rijnsdorp2009 indicate that temperature has a direct effect on physiology, growth, reproduction, recruitment and behavior of poikilothermic organisms such as fish, mollusks, cephalopods and crustaceans. They also identify that temperature will have an effect on life history and ontogeny aspects of species, where different stages of an organism (eggs, larvae, juveniles, adults) can be influenced by temperature differently (Figure 2).

Arrow (a) denotes a range of tolerable temperatures measured for adults during maturation and spawning. (Rijnsdorp et al., 2009)"}

```

According to these results also, it is possible to identify a very narrow temperature tolerance range (thermal niche) at high and low latitudes and with a wide tolerance range at intermediate latitudes (Figure 2).

The change in marine environment temperature affects many physiological processes ranging from protein damage to altering organ function. Environmental changes, especially global warming, can therefore strongly influence fish abundance and distribution through species-specific physiological thresholds of temperature tolerance, or through responses to changes in other trophic levels [@Perry2005; @Rijnsdorp2009; @Saba2014]. In this context, changes in spatial distribution range of marine organisms are among the most perceptible consequences of climate change at global scale, with potentially significant impacts on commercial fishing [@Perry2005; @Barange2014], on food webs and ecosystem functioning and on biodiversity as a whole [@Pinsky2020].

Marine organisms respond to ocean temperature increase through distribution changes, with expected regional changes toward colder, deeper, more marine or polar waters, as well as in the global range [@Cheung2010a; @Pinsky2020; @Frawley2019].

Local temperatures in polar marine ecosystems are increasing twice as fast as the global average [@IPCC2014], leading to a borealization of Arctic animal communities, with decreased abundance of species with polar affinity and increasing abundance of boreal species. It is expected that overall species abundance in semi-enclosed seas (i.e., the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea) and tropical oceanic basins will decrease in the future [@Cheung2013].

## Dissolved oxygen

For its part, oxygen availability poses an upper limit on aerobic metabolism, in which an organism can consume the oxygen required to fuel physiological processes. This is established through diffusion rates across a pressure gradient from the environment [@Duncan2020].

It was recently demonstrated that fish body size can be reduced due to climate change, especially in response to warming, reduced oxygen and resource availability [@Cheung2013]. The IPCC projects that oceans will become warmer and less oxygenated [@IPCC2014].

Climate change is decreasing oxygen concentrations in the open sea [@Isensee2016; @Deutsch2015]. The combined effects of climate change and excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus from sources such as agricultural runoff and human waste) are leading to oxygen decreases in coastal marine systems and semi-enclosed seas that are heavily influenced by their watershed in a global and regional context. Models predict that oxygen content in oceans continues to decrease as atmospheric and oceanic temperatures increase and human population size increases [@Isensee2016].

In this sense, impacts produced by changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the sea translate into important modulation in marine populations and their functioning. Recent evidence suggests that combined effects of warming and oxygen loss together limit geographic distributions of marine ectothermic organisms [@Deutsch2015; @Portner2001; @Isensee2016]. Sufficient oxygen is needed for an organism to survive, feed, defend itself, grow and reproduce. With expected warming by end of century, habitat losses will be particularly acute at equatorial limits [@Deutsch2015]. These results suggest that synergistic impacts of both oxygen and warming are likely to strongly shape future species distributions, biomass, production and ecosystem function.

The limits of thermal tolerance ranges from the equator often coincide with habitats where oxygen supply is two to five times the oxygen demand established by a species' resting metabolic rate [@Deutsch2015]. On the other hand, and according to IPCC projections, oceans will have warmer waters and less dissolved oxygen [@IPCC2014], since warmer temperatures drive higher metabolic rates, which exceed oxygen availability. An example of this was identified in the Mediterranean Sea, where [@Cheung2013] used a Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model, which simulated changes in relative abundance and spatial distribution of marine populations in a global grid, considering ecophysiological aspects, preferences and tolerances to environmental conditions and movement of adult individuals. In this analysis it was determined that average fish weight decreased between 4% to 49% from 1970 to 2050 (Figure 3).

```

However, these studies must be analyzed in detail, since projecting future dissolved oxygen scenarios is a risky task. There is no consensus on the future volume of low-oxygen waters in the open sea due to large uncertainties about possible biogeochemical effects and the evolution of tropical ocean dynamics [@IPCC2014].

## SAM/ENSO

There are global drivers that affect the SO at present and will also affect in the future. Atmospheric-oceanographic drivers are those that manifest through changes produced in the atmosphere and that have implications in the sea, such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Ozone depletion directly influences the main mode of atmospheric circulation variability in the southern extratropical regions. This climate phenomenon is called the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). One way to measure SAM is through an index calculated as the pressure gradient between mid-latitudes and Antarctica, which when very positive, results in westerly winds that are stronger than average and shift poleward. Since 1957 there has been a significant increase in positive SAM phase in austral summer and autumn. The summer trend is believed to be mainly due to stratospheric polar ozone depletion. SAM variability has a significant impact on Antarctic surface temperature, precipitation and sea ice [@Marshall2018].

[@Saba2014] studied the effects of large-scale climate and physical forcing produced by different SAM phases on biological processes in the Antarctic Peninsula. In this study they identified the impacts of seasonal SAM phases (SAM+ and SAM-) on chlorophyll a (chl-a) and diatom productivity and its correlation with krill population dynamics, in which they demonstrated that these phases modify population structure in the bathymetric dimension due to effects of these changes. Figure 4 illustrates how climate and physical oceanographic processes, individual and combined winter and spring (see months July to February on x-axis) cascade from phytoplankton to krill recruitment in a SAM- in July and spring (left panel) and a SAM+ in July and spring (right panel). All other properties (phytoplankton, krill and krill eggs) are generalized for qualitative illustration (+ versus -) and do not represent quantitative differences between negative and positive SAM.

Another oceanographic-atmospheric phenomenon that also has implications in oceans is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). An "El Niño" event consists mainly of above-normal warming of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean surface (greater than 25°C), accompanied by sea level rise (greater than 15 cm). These events that affect the entire Pacific Ocean, even reaching demonstrated effects to the Southern Ocean, occur cyclically but at irregular time intervals that fluctuate between periods of two and ten years. The phenomenon begins in the tropical Pacific Ocean, near Australia and Indonesia, thereby altering atmospheric pressure in very distant zones, there are changes in wind direction and speed, as well as displacement of rain zones to the tropical region. Under normal conditions, also called No-Niño conditions, trade winds (blowing from east to west) accumulate a large amount of water and heat in the western part of this ocean. The sea surface level is consequently approximately half a meter higher in Indonesia than off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador. Furthermore, the difference in sea surface temperature is around 8°C between both Pacific zones. Cold temperatures occur in South America because deep waters rise and produce nutrient-rich water that maintains the marine ecosystem, and within this sustain large pelagic fisheries (anchovy and sardine). No-Niño conditions in South America imply relatively dry atmospheric climate.

In contrast, during El Niño phenomenon trade winds weaken or stop blowing, maximum marine temperature shifts toward the Peru Current which is relatively cold and minimum marine temperature shifts toward Southeast Asia. This causes increased atmospheric pressure in Southeast Asia and decreased pressure in South America. All this change occurs in an interval of six months, approximately from June to November.

An abundant and well-documented literature supports the thesis that fluctuations in the marine environment due to climate phenomena such as El Niño have a notable impact on marine populations, at different time and space scales. To evaluate the effects of this phenomenon in the central-south zone of Chile's coasts, the work of [@Arcos2004] addressed the impacts on pelagic fisheries in the central-south zone of Chile, where changes in the population structure of jack mackerel *Trachurus symmetricus* were identified, causing the fishing industry to collapse, in what is known as the "Crisis of '97" [@Arcos2004].

One of the main effects of El Niño phenomenon that [@Arcos2004] work argues is that the juvenile jack mackerel population "was cornered" in the central-south sector (zone of intense fishing) due to poor water conditions in the north (warmer during El Niño). This resulted in intense exploitation of individuals less than 26 cm (juveniles), with which the commercial stock could not regenerate in subsequent years, decreasing landings and causing well-known havoc. Figure 5 represents a conceptual model of jack mackerel populations under normal ocean conditions (left) and facing El Niño conditions (right).

CC has generated temporal mismatches of oceanographic-atmospheric phenomena that shape marine populations in the southern hemisphere oceans, such as ENSO and SAM [@Saba2014; @Morley2020; @Lovenduski2005]. While marine populations have tried to adapt and synchronize to these interdecadal phenomena, any other natural factor at play, such as global warming, will translate into loss of synchrony between environmental optima and biological productivity of these species, causing drastic changes at the level of physiology, distribution and productivity. [@Barange2014] identified changes in habitat use of sardine and anchovy populations in the Gulf of California and Peru, areas affected by ENSO. These species alternate synchronously in relation to their biomass, and decoupling produced by CC has generated loss of adjustment to optimal climatic conditions of their populations.

While there is some alternation and connection between these two oceanographic-atmospheric phenomena, [@Ehrnsten2019] suggests that it is difficult to test the effect of multiple drivers across a long spatial gradient with empirical studies. However, despite this logistical problem, the influence of these two factors is widely demonstrated by the international scientific community.

## Climate Change in Southern Ocean marine populations

Changes in marine population distribution demonstrate that global warming is directing marine populations toward the poles [@Perry2005; @Parmesan2003], which puts focus on climate change impacts on high-latitude ecosystems and their community and population structures.

While this type of analysis has been conducted with emphasis on oceans around the world, doubts still persist about the effect of previously described drivers on marine populations in high-latitude ecosystems, and more specifically in the Southern Ocean. These doubts have been tried to be resolved, and several studies have addressed this problem in Antarctic species and their correlation with climatic and oceanographic drivers in these types of environments.

Temperature trends are highly variable throughout the Antarctic continent and its adjacent ocean, and rapid warming has occurred mainly over the Antarctic Peninsula, which stands out as a clear and consistent region of rapid changes, while conditions have been much more variable in other sectors [@Turner2005]. In some cases CC effects have an impact that has positive correlation in increasing indicators. [@Pinkerton2021] identified impacts that climate condition changes have on primary producers (phytoplankton) in the last 20 years in the Southern Ocean, identifying an increase in most primary producer biomass in the SO. This positive effect on these variables would be produced by increased nutrients derived from processes such as water column mixing, marine dust input to subsurface layers, and ice cap melting.

Climate change is rapidly altering Antarctic krill *Euphausia superba* habitat, to the point of decimating its populations [@Kruger2021]. This species constitutes a key factor in the Southern Ocean food web, while sustaining a commercial fishery of global proportions [@Atkinson2009]. The dual role of forced climate change and natural variability affecting Antarctic krill habitat and therefore this species' productivity complicates the interaction of any empirically observed trend and contributes to uncertainty in future projections for adequate fishery management [@Sylvester2021].

Target species of current Antarctic fisheries include cod and Antarctic cod *Dissostichus eleginoides* and *D. mawsoni*. Both species are vulnerable to overfishing due to slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity. This natural vulnerability could increase, as communities living in the Antarctic ecosystem also currently face alterations to their environment due to climate change, such as increased water temperature and decreased sea ice. These polar fish (Notothenioidei) are well adapted to cold environmental conditions of the Southern Ocean, so any change in their habitat conditions would have drastic consequences on their population levels [@Mintenbeck2017]. CC does not have uniform impact around Antarctica, since negative effects on fish populations and survival, habitats and indirectly on ecosystems are predicted in some areas [@Vanderhaven2013]. In this sense, and according to [@Hidalgo2011], synergistic effects of fishing, climate and internal dynamics of population fluctuations are poorly understood due to the complexity of these interactions, even more so in a changing condition.

## Environmental variable modelling

To identify the most influential environmental drivers of krill recruitment to be considered in stock evaluation processes, we examined the relationship between a recruitment index and three key environmental variables described previously as critical in shaping krill population dynamics: Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), and Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) [@Flores2012; @Morley2020; @Saba2014; @Veytia2021; @Walsh2020]. Table \@ref(tab:env) summarizes the key characteristics of the environmental datasets used in the analysis, including sea ice, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a. These variables were obtained from different satellite platforms and reanalysis products, namely Nimbus-7, ERA5, and Copernicus. The table details spatial and temporal resolution, as well as the temporal coverage of each dataset.
