## Introduction


In recent decades, evidence of changes in climatic and oceanographic drivers has been demonstrated with profuse scientific evidence which has been well compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@IPCC2014]. The impact of these changes has resulted in perturbations in structure and functioning of ecosystems and have been associated with anthropogenic action [@Marshall2018; @Worm2012] and related to global Climate Change (CC) [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Rijnsdorp2009]. Any perception of a marine environment without changes is today a naive and biased statement. This view is easily contradicted by observing the dramatic evidence of changes in structure, abundance and distribution of species across the temporal scale from years, decades, centuries and millennia [@Pinsky2020]. In all oceans of the world, marine populations are evidencing the effects of CC, either by the sum and/or combination of environmental changing drivers, with solid scientific evidence that demonstrates the effects on responses such as physiology, ecology and observable variables such as distribution, biomass and productivity at local and global scales [@Barange2014; @Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Perry2005; @Rijnsdorp2009].  A driver is defined as any natural or anthropogenic factor that causes direct or indirect changes in an ecosystem. A direct driver has unequivocal influence on ecosystem processes, while an indirect driver operates diffusely, by altering one or more drivers. In marine populations, direct drivers have impact on physiology and phenological aspects, and indirect drivers have impact on primary productivity or ecological interactions, spatial distribution or larval transport [@Koenigstein2016]. These new external conditions are producing impacts on marine ecosystems through changes in habitats [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Shoji2011; @Rijnsdorp2009; @Hidalgo2018], which has effects on population sustainability. Some authors propose that the impacts of CC, through warming of water masses, would trigger changes in spatial distribution patterns of marine organisms making them migrate toward high latitudes [@Cheung2010a; @Kortsch2015; @Melbourne-Thomas2021].

The SO that surrounds Antarctica is a critical component of the marine and terrestrial system, and sustains a marine ecosystem of immense ecological, economic and intrinsic value. This ocean is spatially defined based on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which transports the most water in the entire ocean. This current formed 34 million years ago flows almost freely from west to east around the Antarctic continent, in a fluctuating band that is located approximately at 60º south latitude. At this point the water is colder and less salty than in adjacent oceans. For all these characteristics, this ocean is one of the most sensitive areas to CC. The key drivers and their influence on key processes within the SO have already experienced changes in their attributes, among them can be identified: ocean temperature, sea ice dynamics, stratification, currents, among others [@Sylvester2021; @Morley2020]. Local temperatures in polar marine ecosystems are increasing twice as fast as the global average [@IPCC2014], leading to significant changes in marine communities.


Antarctic krill is a key structural component of the trophic and ecological web in the SO, and the effects of environmental drivers on its productivity are of broad interest, spanning scientific, ecological, and economic dimensions [@Atkinson2009; @Veytia2020; @Pinones2016]. Krill exhibit a complex life cycle that is closely linked to the seasonal dynamics in this ecosystem. <!--(Figure \@ref(fig:pinones))-->. Their development—from eggs and embryos sinking to the seafloor, to larval and juvenile stages ascending through the water column coincides with critical environmental cues such as sea ice extent, chlorophyll-a availability, and ocean temperature. These factors not only influence the timing and success of key developmental stages but also define the spatial structure of krill populations. The reliance on seasonal sea ice and primary productivity highlights the species' vulnerability to climate-driven changes in the region. As such, the close coupling between krill biology and ecosystem variability underscores the delicate balance required to sustain both krill populations and the broader food web they support [@Pinones2016].

```

Changes in marine population distribution demonstrate that global warming is directing marine populations toward the poles [@Perry2005; @Parmesan2003], which puts focus on climate change impacts on high-latitude ecosystems and their community and population structures. Temperature trends are highly variable throughout the Antarctic continent and its adjacent ocean, and rapid warming has occurred mainly over the Antarctic Peninsula [@Turner2005]. @Pinkerton2021 identified impacts that climate condition changes have on primary producers (phytoplankton) in the last 20 years in the Southern Ocean, identifying an increase in most primary producer biomass in the SO. This positive effect would be produced by increased nutrients derived from processes such as water column mixing, marine dust input to subsurface layers, and ice cap melting.

Understanding how the main environmental drivers act and their impact on krill population processes of the most important species in the Southern Ocean, as well as how these species will respond, is fundamental for anticipating climate scenarios. Given this context, the present study seeks to identify the environmental drivers that have significant influence on Antarctic krill recruitment in the Southern Ocean, with the objective of incorporating these environmental variables into the integrated models that will be utilized in subsequent chapters. To achieve this, the analysis will be conducted using linear and/or multivariate correlation models, providing a robust statistical framework for determining which climate drivers most critically affect recruitment dynamics in this keystone Antarctic species. This approach will strengthen the predictive capacity of population models and enhance our ability to forecast krill population responses under changing environmental conditions.

<!-- Temperature regulates the rate of aerobic metabolism through energy consumption for physiological processes, a process accelerated when the organism is subjected to high temperatures. The ocean has warmed incessantly since 2005, showing clear well-documented trends in the 5th IPCC Assessment Report [@IPCC2014]. Depths of 0-700 m and 700-2000 m of the ocean have warmed at rates of 5.31 ± 0.48 and 4.02 ± 0.97 gº year(-1) from 2005 to 2017. [@Rijnsdorp2009] indicate that temperature has a direct effect on physiology, growth, reproduction, recruitment and behavior of poikilothermic organisms such as fish, mollusks, cephalopods and crustaceans. Temperature affects life history and ontogeny aspects of species, where different stages of an organism (eggs, larvae, juveniles, adults) can be influenced by temperature differently. Marine organisms respond to ocean temperature increase through distribution changes, with expected regional changes toward colder, deeper, more marine or polar waters [@Cheung2010a; @Pinsky2020; @Frawley2019]. Interestingly, [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019] made predictions through fish biomass simulations and identified that in the great majority of oceans, the relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) increase and biomass changes were inversely proportional, except for the Southern and Arctic oceans, where temperature changes would benefit marine populations of those ecosystems. These results coincide with [@Koenigstein2016], who pointed to benefits in marine populations of high-latitude ecosystems due to the effect of CC and global warming. -->


<!-- Each developmental stage shows specific environmental requirements and vulnerabilities. Early larval stages are particularly sensitive to temperature variations, with development rates showing strong temperature dependence that can affect timing of seasonal transitions [REF]. Food availability during the calyptopis and early furcilia stages appears critical for successful recruitment, with starvation during these periods leading to high mortality rates [REF]. The extended developmental period creates opportunities for spatial displacement through ocean currents, potentially connecting spawning areas with nursery grounds hundreds or thousands of kilometers away [REF]. This life history strategy maximizes dispersal potential but also increases vulnerability to environmental variability and climate change impacts. -->

<!-- The life cycle of Antarctic krill is intricately adapted to the seasonal ice dynamics of the Southern Ocean, with spawning occurring primarily during the austral summer months when phytoplankton productivity peaks [@Pinones2016; @Saba2014; @Siegel2000]. The demographic structure of krill populations reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with recruitment success heavily dependent on environmental conditions during critical early life stages [@Perry2019; @Perry2020; @Reiss2020; @Cox2011]. To encompass with this environmental conditions, this species exhibit sophisticated behavioral adaptations including diel vertical migration patterns, where individuals migrate vertically through the water column in response to light levels, predator avoidance, and feeding opportunities [@Pinones2016; @Saba2014]. These vertical migrations can extend over several hundred meters, facilitating the transport of nutrients and energy between different ocean layers and contributing to the biological pump. The species also demonstrates remarkable physiological plasticity, including the ability to shrink during food-limited periods and to survive extended periods of starvation through metabolic depression [@Shao2023]. -->

<!-- Sea ice provides essential habitat for krill through multiple mechanisms: it serves as a feeding ground where krill graze on ice-associated algae, provides refuge from predators, and creates favorable conditions for reproduction and larval development [Wiedenmann2009; @Stammerjohn2008a; @Stammerjohn2008b; @Veytia2021; @Walsh2020]. The under-ice environment supports distinct microbial communities that form the base of the ice-associated food web, with krill playing a central role in transferring energy from this primary production to the broader ecosystem [@Saba2014; @Pinones2016]. -->

<!-- Oxygen availability poses an upper limit on aerobic metabolism, in which an organism can consume the oxygen required to fuel physiological processes [@Duncan2020]. Climate change is decreasing oxygen concentrations in the open sea [@Isensee2016; @Deutsch2015]. The IPCC projects that oceans will become warmer and less oxygenated [@IPCC2014]. Recent evidence suggests that combined effects of warming and oxygen loss together limit geographic distributions of marine ectothermic organisms [@Deutsch2015; @Portner2001; @Isensee2016]. The limits of thermal tolerance ranges from the equator often coincide with habitats where oxygen supply is two to five times the oxygen demand established by a species' resting metabolic rate [@Deutsch2015]. These synergistic impacts of both oxygen and warming are likely to strongly shape future species distributions, biomass, production and ecosystem function. Regarding to Large-Scale Oceanographic-Atmospheric drivers, The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) has a proven influence on krill dynamics. Since 1957 there has been a significant increase in positive SAM phase in austral summer and autumn in SO. SAM variability has a significant impact on Antarctic surface temperature, precipitation and sea ice [@Marshall2018]. [@Saba2014] studied the effects of large-scale climate and physical forcing produced by different SAM phases on biological processes in the Antarctic Peninsula. They identified the impacts of seasonal SAM phases (SAM+ and SAM-) on chlorophyll a (chl-a) and diatom productivity and its correlation with krill population dynamics, demonstrating that these phases modify population structure in the bathymetric dimension. Another macroscale driver is El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). An "El Niño" event consists mainly of above-normal warming of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean surface, accompanied by sea level rise. These events affect the entire Pacific Ocean, even reaching demonstrated effects to the Southern Ocean, occurring cyclically but at irregular time intervals that fluctuate between periods of two and ten years. CC has generated temporal mismatches of oceanographic-atmospheric phenomena that shape marine populations in the southern hemisphere oceans, such as ENSO and SAM [@Saba2014; @Morley2020; @Lovenduski2005]. While marine populations have tried to adapt and synchronize to these interdecadal phenomena, any other natural factor at play, such as global warming, will translate into loss of synchrony between environmental optima and biological productivity of these species, causing drastic changes at the level of physiology, distribution and productivity. -->


## Methodology

### Study Area 

The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP, FAO Statistical Subarea 48.1, left panel, Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)), constitutes the primary focus of this thesis. Over the past 50 years, the WAP has emerged as one of the most rapidly warming regions in the Southern Ocean, undergoing significant physical and ecological transformations. Concurrently, it has been the main area area for the Antarctic krill fishery over the last four decades, drawing sustained commercial and scientific interest. The WAP also hosts some of the most comprehensive ecosystem monitoring efforts in the Southern Ocean, including the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP), long-term acoustic surveys led by initiatives such as the U.S. AMLR program, and a growing body of multidisciplinary research run by different National Antarctic Programs (NAP) operating in the area. These initiatives have produced a rich, spatially resolved archive of biological and environmental data, which this thesis harnesses to explore the interplay between krill life-history traits and  environmental variability.

Antarctic krill dynamic relation with environmental drivers were analyzed across five distinct candidate management units (MUs) along the WAP (right panel Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)), each representing ecologically meaningful subregions: Bransfield Strait (BS), a semienclosed basin influenced by both shelf and oceanic waters; Elephant Island (EI)), an important fishing ground with complex hydrography and productivity patterns; Gerlache Strait (GS), a narrow fjord-like system characterized by high krill biomass and predator activity; Joinville Island (JOIN) representing the transitional zone connecting the Bransfield and Gerlache straits; and South Shetland Western Islands (SSWI), encompassing the exposed western shelf of the South Shetland Islands, frequently targeted by the krill fishery. These MUs capture the spatial heterogeneity of krill habitat and are used to evaluate environmental effects and fishing pressure in a spatially explicit framework. In summary, this region is defined by its ecological heterogeneity and marked environmental gradients, offering a unique natural laboratory for investigating the dynamics of Antarctic krill populations.

### Length composition data as indicator of recruitment 

Recruitment estimates were derived from Antarctic krill length requency data of Antarctic krill were obtained from the fishery-dependent observations conducted under the Scheme of International Scientific Observation (SISO) coordinated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The dataset comprises individual total length measurements collected from commercial krill catches over two decades (2000–2020). Sampling was carried out across all active fishing seasons within this period, with data aggregated at a temporal resolution of two periods per year and spatially stratified by Small-Scale Management Units (SSMUs) as defined by CCAMLR. The recruitment index is calculated by first determining the proportion of juvenile krill individuals based on their total length, specifically those under a threshold of 3.6 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:length)). 


```{r length, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Length structures of krill from fishery dependent data. Red line represent recruitment size in 3.6 cm"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Length_Strata_NoChina.png")
```

This proportion is calculated following the method provided by @Perry2020, where the the ratio of juvenile individuals to the total number of krill sampled within a given year and for each MU. The resulting proportion is then transformed using a logarithmic function of length, which represents the log-transformed recruitment index. Next, the values were standardized to fall within a specific range, typically between -1 and 1. This standardization process is achieved by applying the following equation:

$$
\text{Proplog2} = \frac{\text{Proplog} - \text{min}(\text{Proplog})}{\text{max}(\text{Proplog}) - \text{min}(\text{Proplog})} \times (b - a) + a
$$

In this equation, *Proplog* represents the logarithm of the proportion of juvenile krill individuals, while *Proplog2* is the standardized recruitment index, scaled to fall between -1 and 1. The functions *min()* and *max()* refer to the minimum and maximum values of *Proplog* across all observations, which was used to rescale the variable. The parameters *a* and *b* denote the lower and upper bounds of the desired standardization range, and was set to -1 and 1, respectively . Finally, the standardized index was categorized into two groups based on its value: "positive" for values greater than or equal to 0, and "negative" for values below 0 (Figure \@ref(fig:indrecr)). This categorization allows for further analysis of recruitment trends and patterns within the krill population over time. This methodology ensures that the recruitment index is both consistent and comparable across different years and MU.

### Environmental variables and spatial context to model krill recruitment {#env-vars}

To identify the most influential environmental drivers of krill recruitment to be use in stock evaluation processes, i examined the relationship between a recruitment index and three key environmental variables known to shape krill population dynamics: Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) [@Flores2012; @Morley2020; @Saba2014; @Veytia2021; @Walsh2020]. Table \@ref(tab:env) summarizes the main characteristics of the environmental datasets used in this analysis. These variables were obtained from a combination of satellite and reanalysis products, specifically *Nimbus-7* [doi.org/10.5067/QOZIVYV3V9JP](https://doi.org/10.5067/QOZIVYV3V9JP) (Figure \@ref(fig:SICmap)), *ERA5* [doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021](https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021) (Figure \@ref(fig:SSTmap)), and the *E.U. Copernicus Marine Service* [doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148](https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00148) (Figure \@ref(fig:Chlmap)). The table details their spatial and temporal resolutions, as well as the time ranges covered by each dataset. Post-processing techniques, including data cleaning and handling algorithms, manipulation of spatial data, rasterization and projection transformations were facilitated by the *sf* and *ncdf4* packages in R [@Pebezma2018; @Pierce2021]. 

Figure \@ref(fig:envf) illustrates the variables that were used in this analysis, including key environmental drivers, krill biomass, and catch across the five Management Units (MUs) of the Antarctic Peninsula (BS, EI, GS, JOIN, SSWI), highlighting the spatial heterogeneity among them. Catch and biomass data were obtained from the same fishery-dependent monitoring program (SISO) and correspond to the same temporal scale used for recruitment estimates (2000–2020). Biomass estimates were derived from the CCAMLR intersessional work [@Dornam2021], ensuring consistency with the standardized assessment procedures applied within the management framework.

### Correlation analysis

To explore relationships between krill biological metrics (recruitment) and environmental variables, I employed both classical and model-based approaches. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess linear associations between continuous variables. Additionally, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were implemented to evaluate potential nonlinear and multivariate effects, allowing for hypothesis testing under varying distributions and link functions. Together, these methods provided complementary insights into environmental correlations.

#### Pearson test

The Pearson test are statistical methods used to assess the correlation between two variables [@McCulloch2001]. This is the most widely used correlation analysis, which measures the strength of the 'linear' relationships between the raw data from both variables, rather than their ranks. This is an dimensionless coefficient, meaning that there are no data-related boundaries to be considered when conducting analyses with this formula, which is a reason why this coefficient is the first formula researchers try. In the case of the Pearson test, the degree of association between two continuous variables is measured through a correlation coefficient that varies between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfectly positive correlation, a value of -1 indicates a perfectly negative correlation, and a value of 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables.

$$
r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$
The Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) quantifies the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is calculated using paired observations $(x_i, y_i)$, where each value is compared to its respective mean ($\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$). The numerator of the formula represents the covariance between the two variables, summing the product of deviations from the mean $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$, while the denominator is the product of their standard deviations.  

#### Generalized linear and mixed-effects models

Inorder to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of krill recruit from fishery and its relationship with environmental covariates, we applied a series of regression models, including generalized linear models (GLMs) and general linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). Initial GLMs were constructed to assess the fixed effects of year (ANO), spatial strata (ID), sea ice concentration, chlorophyll-a (Chla), and sea surface temperature (TSM) on krill recruit. To account for the hierarchical structure of the data, I incorporated random intercepts for year (ANO) and spatial strata (ID) using the `lme4` package in R. Interactions between ID and ANO were tested to explore whether temporal trends in krill recruit differed across spatial units. Model selection was based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and residual deviance, with lower values indicating better model fit. Variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated to check for multicollinearity among environmental predictors, and when necessary, covariates were standardized or imputed to handle missing data. The inclusion of random effects allowed me to capture unexplained annual variability while accounting for spatial heterogeneity in krill growth patterns. Visualization of model predictions and marginal effects was conducted using the `ggeffects` [@Ludecke2018] and `sjPlot` packages [@Ludecke2024], providing insights into how krill recruit dynamics respond to environmental and spatial drivers over time.  

The analysis of the correlation between the logarithmic recruitment index (*Proplog2*) and environmental variables were approached through a series of regression models designed to examine the impact of various environmental factors on the recruitment process of krill. These models progressively include more explanatory variables, allowing us to evaluate the relative contribution of each environmental factor, as well as potential interactions between them, on the recruitment index. Each model represents a different level of complexity and addresses distinct aspects of the potential relationship between recruitment and environmental conditions.


$\text{Mod 1:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 2:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 Chla_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 3:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 Chla_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 4:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 Chla_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i} + \beta_4 seaice_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 5:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 seaice_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i} + \beta_4 Chla_{i} + \beta_5 (TSM \times Chla)_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 5 Lag:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 seaice_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i-1} + \beta_4 Chla_{i-1} + \beta_5 (TSM_{i-1} \times Chla_{i-1})_{i} + \epsilon_i$


In the first model (Mod 1), the recruitment index is modeled solely as a function of the ID, which represents a baseline level of recruitment. This model serves as a starting point for understanding the overall distribution of recruitment across different IDs without considering any environmental factors. The second model (Mod 2) introduces *Chla* (chlorophyll a concentration) as an additional explanatory variable. This model will allow for the evaluation of how changes in primary production, represented by chlorophyll a, may influence recruitment. The inclusion of chlorophyll a will help determine whether biological productivity, as reflected by phytoplankton concentrations, plays a role in shaping recruitment dynamics. The third model (Mod 3) further expands on the previous one by including *TSM* (total suspended matter), which is a measure of the particulate matter in the water column. This model investigates whether changes in suspended matter, which could affect light penetration and, consequently, primary production, influence recruitment. The model will examine how both chlorophyll a and TSM, as separate environmental variables, contribute to the variation in recruitment. The fourth model (Mod 4) incorporates *seaice* as an additional explanatory factor. Sea ice presence and its seasonal variations have been shown to impact the distribution and availability of krill habitats. By including sea ice in the model, we aim to explore the potential impact of this variable on recruitment, alongside chlorophyll a and suspended matter. The fifth model (Mod 5) introduces an interaction term between *TSM* and *Chla*, which allows for the examination of how the combined effect of these two environmental factors might influence recruitment. This interaction term will help determine whether the relationship between TSM and recruitment is modified by the presence of chlorophyll a, or vice versa. This model will help us understand whether the effects of primary production and suspended matter on recruitment are synergistic or independent. Finally, the model labeled "Mod 5 Lag" considers a lag effect for both TSM and Chla, where the values of these variables from the previous time point are included. The inclusion of lags in the final model will provide insights into the temporal dynamics of the recruitment process, shedding light on how past environmental conditions might influence current recruitment patterns. This represents each model in mathematical terms, where \(\beta\) are the coefficients and \(\epsilon_i\) is the error term. This methodology allows for a comprehensive assessment of the factors affecting krill recruitment and their potential implications for the population dynamics of this important marine species. The data, codes and other documents of this analysis can be found in the following link [Environment and Krill Recruit relation](https://github.com/MauroMardones/Krill_recruit_env)

## Results

The variable distributions used in the models show diverse patterns (Figure \@ref(fig:vardistr)). The variables "biot" and "CATCH" are highly right-skewed, indicating most values are low with some extreme high values. "Chla" also shows a skewed distribution with peaks at lower values. Both "LENGTH" and "LENGTH P75" (recruitment signal) have more symmetric, roughly normal distributions centered around intermediate values. The variable "MAT" (maturity) is concentrated mostly around a value near 2, showing less variability. "seaice" presents a multimodal distribution with distinct peaks at low and high values. "SPR" is skewed towards lower values but with a few larger values present. Finally, "tsm" displays a nearly normal distribution. These distributions indicate a mix of variable types and provided essential insights into the characteristics of our dataset, helping to guide subsequent modeling and statistical analyses.

The correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationships among the variables, representing the output of the Pearson correlation model (Figure \@ref(fig:coor)). The variables `PROLOG` and `PROP` are highly positively correlated, with values around 0.70–0.71. Similarly, `MAT` (presumably maturity) shows strong positive correlations with `LENGTH` (0.78) and `LENGTH_P75` (0.76). On the other hand, `seaice` is negatively correlated with several biological variables: it has a correlation of –0.97 with `tsm`, –0.79 with `Chla`, –0.78 with `MAT`, and –0.81 with `LENGTH`.

Results from GLM models, the results from the GLM with the formula `Proplog2 ~ ID + Year + Chla` (Mod 2) indicate that several predictors have significant effects on krill recruitment. The intercept is negative (-26.08628) but not statistically significant (p = 0.406), and it does not meaningfully influence the response variable. The coefficients for the ID levels EI and JOIN are both negative and statistically significant, with IDEI at -2.63547 (p = 0.003567) and IDJOIN at -1.63256 (p = 0.000246), indicating lower recruitment levels associated with these spatial strata. The coefficient for Year is positive (0.01358) but not significant (p = 0.383), with no meaningful temporal trend in the response variable. Chlorophyll-a (Chla) shows a significant negative effect on Proplog2, with a coefficient of -0.94014 (p = 0.026849), indicating that higher Chla levels are associated with lower recruitment. The model’s null deviance is 10.8104, while the residual deviance is 4.3936, indicating a reduction in deviance due to the inclusion of predictors. The AIC is 39.505, which can be used to compare this model with alternatives, where lower values suggest better fit. The model converged after two iterations of Fisher scoring. 

The Figure \@ref(fig:modelcomp) shows a radar plot comparing the performance of six generalized linear models (GLMs) used to explain variation in krill recruitment using multiple metrics, including R2, RMSE, sigma, and information-theoretic weights (AIC, AICc, BIC) and Table \@ref(tab:tabcomglm) show these perfomance values. Among the models, mod5_R, which includes all environmental variables and an interaction term between TSM and Chla, exhibited the highest R2 and lowest RMSE and sigma values, indicating the best predictive ability and model fit. In contrast, mod2_R, which includes only Chla in addition to spatial ID, had the highest weights for AIC, AICc, and BIC, suggesting that it is the most parsimonious model with strong information-theoretic support. The lagged version of model 5 (mod5_R_lag), which incorporates environmental variables from the previous time step, performed poorly across most metrics, and delayed effects of environmental drivers on recruitment may be weak or not captured at the temporal scale used.

Having identified chlorophyll as an important driver, we analyzed its linear relationship with recruitment across the temporal series. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure6) reveals a significant negative relationship between Chl-a concentration and the recruitment index of Antarctic krill over the 22-year period (2001-2022). The negative slope indicates an inverse relationship where recruitment index decreases as Chl-a concentration increases. This pattern is statistically robust, supported by a correlation coefficient of $R = -0.58$ and a significant p-value of 0.018.

## Discussion

In this thesis chapter, the influence of key environmental variables—sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and chlorophyll-a—on the population dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was analyzed, with a focus on recruitment processes in Subarea 48.1. The results are discussed in terms of their ecological relevance, their potential integration into stock assessment models, and their implications for achieving fisheries management that is more realistic and responsive to environmental variability.

### Environmental drivers of krill population dynamics

About the primary environmental variables that influence krill biomass and population parameters, such as recruitment, is extensively documented in the literature and can be analyzed from multiple perspectives. Several authors indicate that temperature is one of the most influential components [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Drinkwater2005; @Pinones2016; @Veytia2020], where this environmental driver impacts not only ontogenic processes but also physiological aspects of krill. Conversely, drivers such as ice cover have also been identified as significant predictors, particularly for distribution patterns and life cycles [@Walsh2020; @Pinones2016; @Kawaguchi1994]. Finally, chlorophyll, according to the variables analyzed here, has been discussed as both a favorable factor in krill reproductive cycles [@Saba2014] and a influence on aspects of distribution and growth of this species. Additionally, other authors have analyzed these components synergistically [@Morley2020; @Flores2012; @Ryabov2023], as well as other large-scale oceanic or atmospheric drivers [@Yuan2004; @Saba2014; @Lovenduski2005]. In this context, rather than providing a synopsis of variables, our methodological approach focused on statistically isolating variables for use in integrated models, this chapter aimed to quantify the statistical influence of key environmental variables such as sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a on krill recruitment patterns. Through the application of generalized linear models and Pearson correlation analysis, we sought to identify the most statistically significant environmental driver to subsequently incorporate into an integrated stock assessment analysis in [Chapter 4](#chap4). This approach reflects the critical need to explicitly account for environmental variability in population processes as fundamental as krill recruitment, given the demonstrated sensitivity of Antarctic krill to oceanographic conditions.

### Model performance and variable selection

The comparative analysis of Pearson and GLM model formulations revealed distinct differences in explanatory power among environmental predictors, with chlorophyll-a emerging as the most influential factor affecting recruitment success. The results of Model 2, which includes ID, Year, and Chla as predictors, reveal several significant findings. The negative coefficient for chlorophyll-a exhibits a significant relationship with the response variable (p = 0.026849), suggesting that higher levels of chlorophyll-a are associated with lower recruitment values. While the Year variable shows a positive but non-significant effect (p = 0.382954), the model's AIC value (39.505) and residual deviance (4.3936) suggest a reasonable fit with the predictors contributing to explaining variability in the response variable. The statistical isolation of this primary environmental driver provides a robust foundation for its integration into population assessment models, addressing a key limitation in traditional stock assessment approaches that often treat recruitment as a purely stochastic process.

### Chlorophyll-a and Recruitment Relationship

Having identified chlorophyll as an important driver, we analyzed its linear relationship with recruitment across the temporal series. The analysis reveals a significant negative relationship between Chl-a concentration and the recruitment index of Antarctic krill over the 22-year period (2001-2022), supported by a correlation coefficient of R = -0.58 and a significant p-value of 0.018. As identified in our regression analyses, these findings suggest that elevated Chlorophyll-a concentrations are associated with reduced krill recruitment in the study region. This counterintuitive relationship challenges the conventional assumption that higher primary productivity directly translates to enhanced krill recruitment success. The negative correlation may reflect complex ecological dynamics where elevated chlorophyll concentrations could indicate environmental conditions that are suboptimal for krill early life stages.

### Mechanistic interpretations

Several mechanisms could explain this pattern. High chlorophyll concentrations might be associated with altered phytoplankton community composition, potentially favoring species that are less suitable as food sources for krill larvae [@Walsh2020; @Pinkerton2021]. Additionally, elevated chlorophyll levels could reflect environmental disturbances or oceanographic changes that, while promoting phytoplankton growth, may simultaneously create unfavorable conditions for krill reproduction and larval survival. The temporal scale of our analysis suggests this relationship is consistent across multiple years, indicating a systematic rather than episodic ecological pattern. Interestingly, our results also corroborate the influence of environmental variables on krill size variability. Among them, chlorophyll-a emerged as the most significant factor, with a negative effect on krill size. This suggests that higher chlorophyll concentrations may lead to increased recruitment of smaller individuals, as greater availability of phytoplankton provides abundant substrate for the krill population, thereby shifting the size structure toward smaller individuals.

### Implications for integrated stock assessment

Overall, the results highlight that spatial differences and chlorophyll-a levels significantly influence recruitment, whereas temporal variation captured by Year does not appear to be a strong driver. These findings demonstrate that krill population structure is shaped not only by fishing pressure but also by environmental conditions. By incorporating these environmental components into stock assessment models, we enhance our understanding of krill population dynamics in the Antarctic Peninsula, particularly in Subarea 48.1, and improve the ecological realism of predictive models.
