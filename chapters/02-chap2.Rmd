## Introduction


In recent decades, evidence of changes in climatic and oceanographic drivers has been demonstrated with profuse scientific evidence which has been well compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@IPCC2014]. The impact of these changes has resulted in perturbations in structure and functioning of ecosystems and have been associated with anthropogenic action [@Marshall2018; @Worm2012] and related to global Climate Change (CC) [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Rijnsdorp2009]. Any perception of a marine environment without changes is today a naive and biased statement. This view is easily contradicted by observing the dramatic evidence of changes in structure, abundance and distribution of species across the temporal scale from years, decades, centuries and millennia [@Pinsky2020]. In all oceans of the world, marine populations are evidencing the effects of CC, either by the sum and/or combination of environmental changing drivers, with solid scientific evidence that demonstrates the effects on responses such as physiology, ecology and observable variables such as distribution, biomass and productivity at local and global scales [@Barange2014; @Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Perry2005; @Rijnsdorp2009].  A driver is defined as any natural or anthropogenic factor that causes direct or indirect changes in an ecosystem. A direct driver has unequivocal influence on ecosystem processes, while an indirect driver operates diffusely, by altering one or more drivers. In marine populations, direct drivers have impact on physiology and phenological aspects, and indirect drivers have impact on primary productivity or ecological interactions, spatial distribution or larval transport [@Koenigstein2016]. These new external conditions are producing impacts on marine ecosystems through changes in habitats [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Shoji2011; @Rijnsdorp2009; @Hidalgo2018], which has effects on population sustainability. Some authors propose that the impacts of CC, through warming of water masses, would trigger changes in spatial distribution patterns of marine organisms making them migrate toward high latitudes [@Cheung2010a; @Kortsch2015; @Melbourne-Thomas2021].

The Southern Ocean (SO) that surrounds Antarctica is a critical component of the marine and terrestrial system, and sustains a marine ecosystem of immense ecological, economic and intrinsic value. This ocean is spatially defined based on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which transports the most water in the entire ocean. This current formed 34 million years ago flows almost freely from west to east around the Antarctic continent, in a fluctuating band that is located approximately at 60º south latitude. At this point the water is colder and less salty than in adjacent oceans. For all these characteristics, this ocean is one of the most sensitive areas to CC. The key drivers and their influence on key processes within the SO have already experienced changes in their attributes, among them can be identified: ocean temperature, sea ice dynamics, stratification, currents, among others [@Sylvester2021; @Morley2020]. Local temperatures in polar marine ecosystems are increasing twice as fast as the global average [@IPCC2014], leading to significant changes in marine communities.

Antarctic krill is largest marine populations on the planet, among them krill [@Atkinson2009; @Veytia2020; @Pinones2016]. This species is essential in the SO, given that they form structural part of the trophic and ecological web [@Pinones2016; @Atkinson2009]. On the other hand, they are intensively harvested by the fishing industry for more than 50 years, constituting a very important economic activity. In this sense, any impact that the different environmental drivers have on the productivity of these marine species raises multiple interests, ranging from scientific to economic. Antarctic krill exhibit a complex life cycle intricately linked to the seasonal dynamics of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (Figure \@ref(fig:pinones)). Their development—from eggs and embryos sinking to the seafloor, to larval and juvenile stages ascending through the water column—coincides with critical environmental cues such as sea ice extent, chlorophyll-a availability, and ocean temperature. These factors not only influence the timing and success of key developmental stages but also define the spatial structure of krill populations. The reliance on seasonal sea ice and primary productivity highlights the species' vulnerability to climate-driven changes in the region. As such, the close coupling between krill biology and ecosystem variability underscores the delicate balance required to sustain both krill populations and the broader food web they support [@Pinones2016].

```{r pinones, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Seasonal life cycle of Antarctic krill and their vertical distribution in the water column. The diagram shows developmental stages from embryos to juveniles, aligned with seasonal changes in environmental drivers. Critical periods and the influence of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) are indicated"}

```

Changes in marine population distribution demonstrate that global warming is directing marine populations toward the poles [@Perry2005; @Parmesan2003], which puts focus on climate change impacts on high-latitude ecosystems and their community and population structures. Temperature trends are highly variable throughout the Antarctic continent and its adjacent ocean, and rapid warming has occurred mainly over the Antarctic Peninsula [@Turner2005]. [@Pinkerton2021] identified impacts that climate condition changes have on primary producers (phytoplankton) in the last 20 years in the Southern Ocean, identifying an increase in most primary producer biomass in the SO. This positive effect would be produced by increased nutrients derived from processes such as water column mixing, marine dust input to subsurface layers, and ice cap melting.

Understanding what are and how the main drivers act and their impact on krill population processes of the most important species that inhabit the SO and how these species will respond to this influence is fundamental to understand and anticipate climate scenarios. Multiple evidence demonstrates and quantifies the impact of several drivers on different groups of marine species, and it is necessary to understand how these changes in environmental drivers will impact high-latitude ecosystems and how marine species that inhabit there will respond. Given this context, the present study seeks to identify the environmental drivers that have the greatest statistically significant influence on Antarctic krill recruitment in the Southern Ocean, with the objective of incorporating these environmental variables into the integrated models that will be utilized in subsequent chapters. This approach will provide a robust statistical foundation for understanding which climate drivers most critically affect recruitment dynamics of this keystone Antarctic species, thereby improving the predictive capacity of population models and enhancing our ability to forecast krill population responses under changing environmental conditions.


## Methodology

### Study Area 

The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), specifically within the FAO Statistical Subarea 48.1 (Figure \@ref(fig:studyarea)), constitutes the primary focus of this thesis. Over the past 50 years, the WAP has emerged as one of the most rapidly warming regions in the Southern Ocean, undergoing significant physical and ecological transformations. Concurrently, it has been the principal harvesting area for the Antarctic krill fishery over the last four decades, drawing sustained commercial and scientific interest. The WAP also hosts some of the most comprehensive ecosystem monitoring efforts in the Southern Ocean, including the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP), long-term acoustic surveys led by initiatives such as the U.S. AMLR program, and a growing body of multidisciplinary research. These initiatives have produced a rich, spatially resolved archive of biological and environmental data, which this thesis harnesses to explore the interplay between krill life-history traits, environmental variability, and fishing pressure. In doing so, the study aims to inform adaptive, ecosystem-based management approaches within this increasingly dynamic polar marine ecosystem. 

Antarctic krill dynamic relation with environmental drivers were analyzed across five distinct management units (MUs) along the WAP, each representing ecologically meaningful subregions: Bransfield Strait (BS), a semi-enclosed basin influenced by both shelf and oceanic waters; Elephant Island (EI)), an important fishing ground with complex hydrography and productivity patterns; Gerlache Strait (GS), a narrow fjord-like system characterized by high krill biomass and predator activity; Joinville Island (JOIN) representing the transitional zone connecting the Bransfield and Gerlache straits; and South Shetland Western Islands (SSWI), encompassing the exposed western shelf of the South Shetland Islands, frequently targeted by the krill fishery. These MUs capture the spatial heterogeneity of krill habitat and are used to evaluate environmental effects and fishing pressure in a spatially explicit framework. In summary, this region is defined by its ecological heterogeneity and marked environmental gradients, offering a unique natural laboratory for investigating the dynamics of Antarctic krill populations.

```

### Length composition data as indicator of recruitment 

The recruitment index is calculated by first determining the proportion of juvenile krill individuals based on their total length, specifically those under a threshold of 3.6 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:length)). 

```{r length, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Length structures of krill from fishery dependent data. Red line represent recruitment size in 3.6 cm"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Length_Strata_NoChina.png")
```
This proportion is calculated as the ratio of juvenile individuals to the total number of krill sampled within a given year and for each identified group (ID). The resulting proportion is then transformed using a logarithmic function of length, which represents the log-transformed recruitment index. This analysis was made follow @Perry2020 method. Next, the *Proplog* values are standardized to fall within a specific range, typically between -1 and 1. This standardization process is achieved by applying the following equation:

$$
\text{Proplog2} = \frac{\text{Proplog} - \text{min}(\text{Proplog})}{\text{max}(\text{Proplog}) - \text{min}(\text{Proplog})} \times (b - a) + a
$$

In this equation, *Proplog* represents the logarithm of the proportion of juvenile krill individuals, while *Proplog2* is the standardized recruitment index, scaled to fall between -1 and 1. The functions *min()* and *max()* refer to the minimum and maximum values of *Proplog* across all observations, which are used to rescale the variable. The parameters *a* and *b* denote the lower and upper bounds of the desired standardization range, and are set to -1 and 1, respectively . Finally, the standardized index is categorized into two groups based on its value: "positive" for values greater than or equal to 0, and "negative" for values below 0 (Figure \@ref(fig:indrecr)). This categorization allows for further analysis of recruitment trends and patterns within the krill population over time. This methodology ensures that the recruitment index is both consistent and comparable across different years and groups.

### Environmental variables and spatial context to model krill recruitment

To identify the most influential environmental drivers of krill recruitment for use in stock evaluation processes, we examined the relationship between a recruitment index and three key environmental variables known to shape krill population dynamics: *Sea Surface Temperature (SST)*, *Sea Ice Concentration (SIC)*, and *Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)* [@Flores2012; @Morley2020; @Saba2014; @Veytia2021; @Walsh2020]. Table \@ref(tab:env) summarizes the main characteristics of the environmental datasets used in this analysis. These variables were obtained from a combination of satellite and reanalysis products, specifically *Nimbus-7*, *ERA5*, and the *E.U. Copernicus Marine Service*. The table details their spatial and temporal resolutions, as well as the time ranges covered by each dataset.

```{r env, eval=TRUE}

env_features <- data.frame(
  Feature = c("Sea Ice", "SST", "Chlorophyll a"),
  Platform = c("Nimbus-7", "ERA5", "E.U. Copernicus Marine Service"),

Figure \@ref(fig:envf) illustrates the spatial heterogeneity of these key environmental variables along with krill biomass and fishery catch data across the five management units (BS, EI, GS, JOIN, SSWI) of the Antarctic Peninsula. Substantial variability is observed across strata: Biomass, catch, SST trends, Sea ice cover and Chlorophyll-a

### Correlation analysis

To explore relationships between krill biological metrics and environmental variables, we employed both classical and model-based approaches. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess linear associations between continuous variables. Additionally, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were implemented to evaluate potential nonlinear and multivariate effects, allowing for hypothesis testing under varying distributions and link functions. Together, these methods provided complementary insights into environmental correlations.

#### Pearson test

The Pearson test are statistical methods used to assess the correlation between two variables [@McCulloch2001]. This is the most widely used correlation analysis, which measures the strength of the 'linear' relationships between the raw data from both variables, rather than their ranks. This is an dimensionless coefficient, meaning that there are no data-related boundaries to be considered when conducting analyses with this formula, which is a reason why this coefficient is the first formula researchers try. In the case of the Pearson test, the degree of association between two continuous variables is measured through a correlation coefficient that varies between -1 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfectly positive correlation, a value of -1 indicates a perfectly negative correlation, and a value of 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables.

$$
r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$
The Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) quantifies the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is calculated using paired observations $(x_i, y_i)$, where each value is compared to its respective mean ($\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$). The numerator of the formula represents the covariance between the two variables, summing the product of deviations from the mean $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$, while the denominator is the product of their standard deviations.  

#### GLMM models

To evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of krill recruit from fishery and its relationship with environmental covariates, we applied a series of regression models, including generalized linear models (GLMs) and general linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). Initial GLMs were constructed to assess the fixed effects of year (ANO), spatial strata (ID), sea ice concentration, chlorophyll-a (Chla), and sea surface temperature (TSM) on krill recruit. To account for the hierarchical structure of the data, we incorporated random intercepts for year (ANO) and spatial strata (ID) using the `lme4` package in R. Interactions between ID and ANO were tested to explore whether temporal trends in krill recruit differed across spatial units. Model selection was based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and residual deviance, with lower values indicating better model fit. Variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated to check for multicollinearity among environmental predictors, and when necessary, covariates were standardized or imputed to handle missing data. The inclusion of random effects allowed us to capture unexplained annual variability while accounting for spatial heterogeneity in krill growth patterns. Visualization of model predictions and marginal effects was conducted using the `ggeffects` and `sjPlot` packages [@Ludecke2024], providing insights into how krill recruit dynamics respond to environmental and spatial drivers over time.  


### Statisticals models

The analysis of the correlation between the recruitment index (*Proplog2*) and environmental variables will be approached through a series of regression models designed to examine the impact of various environmental factors on the recruitment process of krill. These models progressively include more explanatory variables, allowing us to evaluate the relative contribution of each environmental factor, as well as potential interactions between them, on the recruitment index. Each model represents a different level of complexity and addresses distinct aspects of the potential relationship between recruitment and environmental conditions.

In the first model (Mod 1), the recruitment index is modeled solely as a function of the ID, which represents a baseline level of recruitment. This model serves as a starting point for understanding the overall distribution of recruitment across different IDs without considering any environmental factors.

The second model (Mod 2) introduces *Chla* (chlorophyll a concentration) as an additional explanatory variable. This model will allow for the evaluation of how changes in primary production, represented by chlorophyll a, may influence recruitment. The inclusion of chlorophyll a will help determine whether biological productivity, as reflected by phytoplankton concentrations, plays a role in shaping recruitment dynamics.

The third model (Mod 3) further expands on the previous one by including *TSM* (total suspended matter), which is a measure of the particulate matter in the water column. This model investigates whether changes in suspended matter, which could affect light penetration and, consequently, primary production, influence recruitment. The model will examine how both chlorophyll a and TSM, as separate environmental variables, contribute to the variation in recruitment.

The fourth model (Mod 4) incorporates *seaice* as an additional explanatory factor. Sea ice presence and its seasonal variations have been shown to impact the distribution and availability of krill habitats. By including sea ice in the model, we aim to explore the potential impact of this variable on recruitment, alongside chlorophyll a and suspended matter.

The fifth model (Mod 5) introduces an interaction term between *TSM* and *Chla*, which allows for the examination of how the combined effect of these two environmental factors might influence recruitment. This interaction term will help determine whether the relationship between TSM and recruitment is modified by the presence of chlorophyll a, or vice versa. This model will help us understand whether the effects of primary production and suspended matter on recruitment are synergistic or independent.

Finally, the model labeled "Mod 5 Lag" considers a lag effect for both TSM and Chla, where the values of these variables from the previous time point are included. This lag effect will help us assess whether past environmental conditions influence current recruitment levels, reflecting the potential delayed response of the ecosystem to changes in these variables.

By comparing the results of these models, we can systematically evaluate the contribution of each environmental factor and their interactions to the recruitment index. The inclusion of lags in the final model will provide insights into the temporal dynamics of the recruitment process, shedding light on how past environmental conditions might influence current recruitment patterns. This methodology allows for a comprehensive assessment of the factors affecting krill recruitment and their potential implications for the population dynamics of this important marine species.

$\text{Mod 1:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 2:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 Chla_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 3:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 Chla_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 4:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 Chla_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i} + \beta_4 seaice_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 5:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 seaice_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i} + \beta_4 Chla_{i} + \beta_5 (TSM \times Chla)_{i} + \epsilon_i$

$\text{Mod 5 Lag:} \quad Proplog2_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ID_{i} + \beta_2 seaice_{i} + \beta_3 TSM_{i-1} + \beta_4 Chla_{i-1} + \beta_5 (TSM_{i-1} \times Chla_{i-1})_{i} + \epsilon_i$


This represents each model in mathematical terms, where \(\beta\) are the coefficients and \(\epsilon_i\) is the error term.

## Results

We explore the distribution of numerical variables in our dataset using a histogram analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:vardistr)). First, we excluded non-numeric variables (`ID`, `Year`, `SE SPR`, and `cvto`) to focus on the remaining quantitative data. The results from this exploratory analysis provided essential insights into the characteristics of our dataset, helping to guide subsequent modeling and statistical analyses.

The correlation matrix that visualizes the pairwise relationships between variables using both color intensity and numerical values. Yellow indicates strong positive correlations (close to +1), green indicates strong negative correlations (close to –1), and lighter colors represent weaker correlations (closer to 0). The size of each circle is also proportional to the strength of the correlation. The correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationships among the variables (Figure \@ref(fig:coor)). The variables `PROLOG` and `PROP` are highly positively correlated, with values around 0.70–0.71. Similarly, `MAT` (presumably maturity) shows strong positive correlations with `LENGTH` (0.78) and `LENGTH_P75` (0.76), suggesting that as individuals grow larger, their maturity increases. On the other hand, `seaice` is negatively correlated with several biological variables: it has a correlation of –0.97 with `tsm`, –0.79 with `Chla`, –0.78 with `MAT`, and –0.81 with `LENGTH`. This suggests that higher sea ice coverage is associated with lower temperature, lower chlorophyll a concentration, lower maturity, and smaller lengths. Moderate positive correlations are also observed among `SPR`, `SE SPR`, and `CATCH`, as well as between `biot`, `cvto`, and the productivity indices. This pattern may indicate a potential linkage between biological productivity and reproductive metrics.

Regarding GLM models, the results from the GLM with the formula `Proplog2 ~ ID + Year + Chla` (Mod_2) indicate that several predictors have significant effects on krill recruitment. The intercept is negative (-26.08628) but not statistically significant (p = 0.406), suggesting it does not meaningfully influence the response variable. The coefficients for the ID levels EI and JOIN are both negative and statistically significant, with IDEI at -2.63547 (p = 0.003567) and IDJOIN at -1.63256 (p = 0.000246), indicating lower recruitment levels associated with these spatial strata. The coefficient for Year is positive (0.01358) but not significant (p = 0.383), suggesting no meaningful temporal trend in the response variable. Chlorophyll-a (Chla) shows a significant negative effect on Proplog2, with a coefficient of -0.94014 (p = 0.026849), indicating that higher Chla levels are associated with lower recruitment. The model’s null deviance is 10.8104, while the residual deviance is 4.3936, indicating a reduction in deviance due to the inclusion of predictors. The AIC is 39.505, which can be used to compare this model with alternatives, where lower values suggest better fit. The model converged after two iterations of Fisher scoring. Overall, the results highlight that spatial differences and Chla levels significantly influence recruitment, whereas temporal variation captured by Year does not appear to be a strong driver.

The Figure \@ref(fig:modelcomp) shows a radar plot comparing the performance of six generalized linear models (GLMs) used to explain variation in krill recruitment (Proplog2) based on environmental predictors such as Chlorophyll-a (Chla), sea surface temperature (TSM), and sea ice concentration. The models were evaluated using multiple metrics, including R2, RMSE, sigma, and information-theoretic weights (AIC, AICc, BIC). Among the models, mod5_R, which includes all environmental variables and an interaction term between TSM and Chla, exhibited the highest R2 and lowest RMSE and sigma values, indicating the best predictive ability and model fit. In contrast, mod2_R, which includes only Chla in addition to spatial ID, had the highest weights for AIC, AICc, and BIC, suggesting that it is the most parsimonious model with strong information-theoretic support. The lagged version of model 5 (mod5_R_lag), which incorporates environmental variables from the previous time step, performed poorly across most metrics, suggesting that delayed effects of environmental drivers on recruitment may be weak or not captured at the temporal scale used. The Table \@ref(tab:tabcomglm) show metrisc of GLMs models perfomances. Overall, the comparison highlights that including multiple environmental drivers and their interactions improves model performance, although simpler models may still be favored based on model selection criteria.

Finally, Figure \@ref(fig:Figure6) show negative relation between Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and the recruitment index of Antarctic krill across multiple years from 2001 to 2022. 

```{r Figure6, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, out.width="75%", fig.cap= "Relationship between mean annual chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and the standardized krill recruit index across years (2001-2022). Each point represents a year and is color-coded accordingly. The black line represents a linear regression fit with a 95% confidence interval"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure6-1 2.jpeg")
```

Each point represents a year, colored accordingly, and the black regression line with a shaded 95% confidence interval illustrates the linear trend between the two variables. The negative slope of the line indicates an inverse relationship: as Chl-a increases, the recruitment index tends to decrease. This pattern is statistically significant, as shown by the correlation coefficient $R = -0.58$ and a p-value of 0.018. These results suggest that higher levels of Chlorophyll-a are associated with lower recruitment of krill in the study area. 

## Discussion


The results of Model 2, which includes `ID`, `Year`, and `Chla` as predictors for `Proplog2`, reveal several significant findings. The negative coefficient for `IDEI` indicates that as `IDEI` increases, the response variable `Proplog2` decreases, with a statistically significant p-value (0.003567). Similarly, the negative coefficient for `IDJOIN` suggests that an increase in `IDJOIN` also leads to a decrease in `Proplog2`, and this relationship is highly significant (p = 0.000246).

While the `Year` variable shows a positive but non-significant effect (p = 0.382954), suggesting that the year does not have a notable impact on `Proplog2`, the `Chla` variable exhibits a significant negative relationship with the response variable (p = 0.026849). This suggests that higher levels of chlorophyll-a (`Chla`) are associated with lower values of `Proplog2`.

The model’s AIC value (39.505) and residual deviance (4.3936) suggest a reasonable fit, with the predictors included contributing to explaining the variability in the response variable. However, given that `Year` is not statistically significant, further investigation could explore alternative variables or transformations to improve the model's explanatory power.


Additionally, our results corroborate the influence of environmental variables on krill size variability. Among them, chlorophyll-a emerged as the most significant factor, with a negative effect on krill size. This result has relation with finding in [REF, REF, REF]. This suggests that higher chlorophyll concentrations lead to increased recruitment, as the greater availability of phytoplankton provides a more abundant substrate for the krill population, thereby shifting the size structure toward smaller individuals.  

Overall, these findings demonstrate that krill population structure is shaped not only by fishing pressure but also by environmental conditions. By incorporating these environmental components into stock assessment models, we enhance our understanding of krill population dynamics in the Antarctic Peninsula, particularly in Subarea 48.1, and improve the ecological realism of predictive models such as LBSPR.
