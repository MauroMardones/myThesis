# Abstract {-}


To comprehensively understand krill and its ecosystem context, it is necessary to separate the process into at least four distinct components: population complexity, spatiotemporal differences in dynamics, environmental and ecosystem relationships, and the implications of the fishing industry on this organism. In this thesis, the following chapters address each of these dimensions, thereby providing greater certainty in contributing to scientific knowledge as well as to the sustainable management of its fishery.


# Introduction


The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) represents one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing marine ecosystems on Earth [REF], serving as a critical habitat for Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*), a keystone species that forms the foundation of the Southern Ocean food web [REF]. This euphausiid crustacean exhibits complex population dynamics that are intrinsically linked to oceanographic processes, climate variability, and anthropogenic pressures, making it a species of paramount ecological and commercial importance [REF]. *Euphausia superba* exhibits remarkable biological complexity that underlies its ecological success in the harsh Antarctic environment. The species demonstrates a circumpolar distribution with distinct regional population structures, characterized by large-scale spawning aggregations and extensive horizontal migrations that can span thousands of kilometers [REF]. The life cycle of Antarctic krill is intricately adapted to the seasonal ice dynamics of the Southern Ocean, with spawning occurring primarily during the austral summer months when phytoplankton productivity peaks [REF]. 

The demographic structure of krill populations reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with recruitment success heavily dependent on environmental conditions during critical early life stages [REF]. Larval development follows a complex pattern involving multiple molting stages, from nauplii through various zoeal and furcilia stages before reaching juvenile and adult forms [REF]. This extended developmental period, lasting up to two years, creates substantial variability in year-class strength and population stability [REF].

Krill exhibit sophisticated behavioral adaptations including diel vertical migration patterns, where individuals migrate vertically through the water column in response to light levels, predator avoidance, and feeding opportunities [REF]. These migrations can extend over several hundred meters, facilitating the transport of nutrients and energy between different ocean layers and contributing to the biological pump [REF]. The species also demonstrates remarkable physiological plasticity, including the ability to shrink during food-limited periods and to survive extended periods of starvation through metabolic depression [REF].

Reproductive strategies in *E. superba* show considerable flexibility, with females capable of multiple spawning events during favorable seasons and the ability to reabsorb developing eggs during adverse conditions [REF]. Population growth rates are highly variable, influenced by factors including food availability, temperature, sea ice extent, and predation pressure [REF]. Recent studies have identified genetic population structure across the Southern Ocean, suggesting limited gene flow between regional populations and potential local adaptation to environmental conditions [REF].

## Ecosystem Relationships and Trophic Dynamics

Antarctic krill occupies a pivotal position in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, serving as the primary link between primary producers and higher trophic levels [REF]. The species exhibits omnivorous feeding behavior, consuming phytoplankton, particularly diatoms, as well as copepods, protozoans, and detrital material [REF]. This flexible feeding strategy allows krill to exploit diverse food sources and adapt to seasonal and spatial variations in prey availability [REF].

The relationship between krill and sea ice represents one of the most critical ecosystem interactions in the Antarctic. Sea ice provides essential habitat for krill through multiple mechanisms: it serves as a feeding ground where krill graze on ice-associated algae, provides refuge from predators, and creates favorable conditions for reproduction and larval development [REF]. The under-ice environment supports distinct microbial communities that form the base of the ice-associated food web, with krill playing a central role in transferring energy from this primary production to the broader ecosystem [REF].

Krill populations exhibit complex predator-prey relationships with numerous Antarctic species. Baleen whales, particularly blue, fin, humpback, and minke whales, depend heavily on krill aggregations for feeding, with some species consuming several tons of krill daily during the feeding season [REF]. Crabeater seals, despite their name, are specialized krill predators with morphological adaptations for filtering krill from the water [REF]. The Antarctic food web also includes numerous seabird species, including Ad√©lie, chinstrap, and gentoo penguins, which rely on krill as a primary food source during breeding seasons [REF].

The ecosystem role of krill extends beyond direct trophic interactions to include significant biogeochemical functions. Through their vertical migrations and excretion, krill contribute to nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in the Southern Ocean [REF]. Their fecal pellets represent a major pathway for carbon export to deep waters, while their molting and mortality contribute to the particulate organic matter pool [REF].

Climate change impacts on the WAP ecosystem are manifesting through alterations in krill population dynamics and distribution patterns. Rising temperatures, changes in sea ice extent and duration, and shifts in ocean chemistry are affecting krill habitat quality and prey availability [REF]. These environmental changes have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem, influencing predator populations and altering energy flow pathways [REF].

## Fishery Implications and CCAMLR Management Context

The commercial exploitation of Antarctic krill has evolved into a significant fishery with important implications for ecosystem management and conservation. The krill fishery in the Southern Ocean, including the WAP region, operates under the regulatory framework of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which implements an ecosystem-based management approach [REF]. This fishery primarily targets krill for the production of krill meal, krill oil, and direct human consumption products, with annual catches reaching several hundred thousand tons [REF].

The spatial and temporal distribution of krill fishing activities in the WAP region is concentrated in areas of high krill biomass, particularly around the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula itself [REF]. These fishing grounds overlap significantly with critical feeding areas for krill-dependent predators, creating potential for ecological interactions and competition [REF]. The fishery operates primarily during the austral summer months when krill form dense surface swarms that are accessible to fishing vessels [REF].

CCAMLR's management framework for the krill fishery is based on the precautionary approach and ecosystem-based management principles, recognizing the central role of krill in the Antarctic ecosystem [REF]. The current management system includes overall catch limits, spatial restrictions, and seasonal closures designed to minimize impacts on krill-dependent predators and ecosystem functioning [REF]. The total allowable catch for the Southwest Atlantic sector, which includes the WAP region, is set at 5.61 million tons annually, though actual catches have historically been much lower [REF].

Recent developments in krill fishery management include the implementation of fine-scale management measures that distribute fishing effort both spatially and temporally to reduce concentration of fishing activities in sensitive areas [REF]. These measures aim to maintain krill availability for predators while allowing sustainable commercial exploitation [REF]. The management system also incorporates real-time monitoring of fishing activities and ecosystem indicators to adaptive management responses [REF].

The sustainability of krill fisheries in the context of climate change presents significant challenges for management. Projected changes in krill distribution and abundance due to environmental variability require adaptive management strategies that can respond to ecosystem changes [REF]. The development of management procedures that incorporate climate variability and ecosystem indicators represents an ongoing priority for CCAMLR [REF].

Future research priorities for krill population dynamics and fishery management in the WAP region include improved understanding of population connectivity, climate change impacts on recruitment success, and the development of ecosystem models that can predict krill population responses to environmental change [REF]. These research needs are critical for maintaining the sustainability of both the krill fishery and the broader Antarctic ecosystem in the face of ongoing environmental change [REF].

The integration of traditional fisheries science with ecosystem-based management approaches represents a paradigm shift in how krill populations are managed, recognizing their fundamental role in ecosystem functioning and the need for precautionary management in the face of uncertainty [REF]. This approach acknowledges that the management of krill populations must consider not only the sustainability of the target species but also the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and the conservation of dependent species [REF].
