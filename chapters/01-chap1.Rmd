# Abstract {-}

Antarctic krill plays a central ecological and fisheries role in the Southern Ocean, requiring management and conservation measures grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the biology, population dynamics and ecosystem, as well as the application of advanced methods for assessing its population dynamics. Traditional assessment approaches have focused primarily on fishery-dependent data, often overlooking the role of environmental variability, predator dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity in shaping krill population processes. In recent years, there has been a growing need to integrate the diverse information available on krill into a unified and integrated model, drawing from multiple sources including fishery-dependent monitoring, scientific surveys, and ecosystem indicators such as predator variables and environmental time series. This dissertation develops an ecosystem-informed stock assessment framework for krill in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Subarea 48.1), integrating physical and biological covariates into population models to improve realism and management relevance. First, we modeled the influence of environmental indicators on krill recruitment and population structure responses using linear regressions. Model outputs indicate that recruitment is significantly correlated with both lagged sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (R2 = 0.27, p < 0.01) and spring chlorophyll-a concentrations (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.05), suggesting that early life stages of krill are sensitive to oceanographic conditions. Preliminary analyses also suggest that recruit are modulated by spatial-temporal variability in food availability, although these relationships remain less statistically robust. An integrated catch-at-length stock assessment model implemented in Stock Synthesis using the 'areas-as-fleets' approach to capture spatial heterogeneity in fishing effort and krill productivity. Environmental covariates such as chlorophyll-a concentration was included as explanatory variables for recruitment and natural mortality, while penguin foraging activity was incorporated as a dynamic proxy for predation pressure. The inclusion of environmental and predator variables led to more biologically realistic models but at the cost of reduced statistical performance, as reflected in higher model uncertainty and lower fit metrics (e.g., AIC increase of 5–8 units). This trade-off highlights the tension between model realism and statistical robustness, suggesting that ecosystem-informed models may offer greater explanatory power and management relevance, but require careful balancing against model simplicity and parsimony. In the final step, simulation-based management strategy evaluation (MSE) using a shortcut approach demonstrated that including these covariates in the operating model reduces bias in biomass estimates and improves the probability of maintaining spawning biomass above 75% of biomasa virginal over 10-year projections under precautionary harvest strategies. 

This thesis enables a detailed analysis of krill population dynamics and its fishery in Subarea 48.1 of the WAP, confronting the challenge of considering multiple aspects that lie at the frontier of global stock assessment. It emphasizes the importance of embracing ecological complexity in stock assessment, particularly under the pressures of climate-driven change in polar ecosystems. The ultimate goal of these analysis is to raise the standard of krill stock assessments in support of science-based recommendations to CCAMLR, in line with the ongoing development of a new krill fishery management strategy that incorporates both ecosystem and spatial considerations.

Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) occupies a central position in the Southern Ocean (SO) given its ecological prominence and commercial significance, particularly in FAO Statistical Subarea 48.1 of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) [@Constable2023; @McBride2021; @Saba2014; @Atkinson2022; @Atkinson2019; @Kawaguchi2023; @Cavan2019], and understanding the population dynamics of this species is essential for effective management and conservation [@Kawaguchi2023]. A comprehensive understanding of krill dynamics requires examining its biology, reproduction, environmental drivers, ecological role, spatial structure, and the management of its fishery, including the implications for both the population and the ecosystem. This thesis provides a conceptual foundation and advances the state of the art in krill population modeling by developing cutting-edge integrated assessment frameworks that align with the realities of *Euphausia superba* dynamics and the broader goals of precautionary management under climate uncertainty in the Western Antarctic Peninsula.

## Biological and reproductive strategies

The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing marine ecosystems on the planet [@McBride2021; @Morley2020; @Stammerjohn2008a; @Turner2005a]. This region represents a critical habitat for Antarctic krill, making it essential to understand how these external conditions influence the ontogeny, reproduction, physiology, and overall biology of this ecologically pivotal organism. Antarctic krill exhibit a remarkably complex life cycle characterized by an extended developmental pathway comprising several larval stages [@Thanassekos2014; @Bahlburg2023]. Larval development follows a sequential progression from nauplii through various zoea and furcilia stages before individuals reach juvenile and adult forms [@Bahlburg2023; @Perry2019]. This intricate developmental process can extend over 2-3 years before sexual maturity is achieved, with the prolonged larval period creating substantial variability in year-class strength and contributing to overall population instability. The extended duration of early life stages renders krill populations particularly vulnerable to environmental fluctuations during critical developmental windows, as adverse conditions during any of these successive molting phases can significantly impact recruitment success and subsequent population dynamics [@McBride2021]. Reproductive strategies in krill show considerable flexibility and the ability to reabsorb developing eggs during adverse conditions [@Atkinson2019; @Walsh2020]. This reproductive plasticity extends to spawning frequency, with females capable of multiple spawning events (2-4 times) during favorable seasons, but reverting to single spawning or reproductive abstinence during poor years [@Siegel2000; @Reid2010; @Siegel1991; @CCAMLR2021c]. Krill population growth rates show extreme variability, ranging from rapid exponential growth during favorable years to significant population declines during poor recruitment periods [@Pakhomov1995; @Reiss2016]. The relationship between adult stock size and recruitment shows significant variability, suggesting that environmental factors during spawning and larval development are more important than parental stock size in determining recruitment success [@Kinzey2019; @Kawaguchi2023; @Veytia2021]. Antarctic krill exhibit pronounced diel vertical migration patterns, primarily driven by light levels, with krill showing strong negative phototaxis during daylight hours, with individuals migrating from depths of 50-100 meters during daylight hours to surface waters at night [@Cutter2022; @Siegel2000]. All these behavior are modified by numerous factors including predator presence, food availability, reproductive state, and oceanographic conditions. 

## Environmental drivers

Understanding how climate-driven environmental variability influences marine populations, such as krill, iis critical for predicting species' responses in polar regions. One of most influential driver in the ocean is the temperature [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019] because regulates metabolic rates and physiological processes in poikilothermic organisms like krill. Since 2005, warming trends have been documented across ocean depths [@IPCC2014], with known effects on fish, mollusks, cephalopods, and crustaceans [@Rijnsdorp2009]. Species distributions shift toward colder and deeper waters in response to warming [@Cheung2010a; @Pinsky2020], although high-latitude ecosystems like the Southern Ocean may see biomass benefits [@Bryndum-Buchholz2019; @Koenigstein2016]. Krill early life stages are particularly sensitive to temperature, affecting development rates and recruitment success [@Perry2019]. In example, sea ice is essential to krill ecology, offering habitat, feeding grounds, predator refuge, and developmental conditions [@Stammerjohn2008a; @Veytia2021]. Krill exploit under-ice algal resources and display diel vertical migration for feeding and predator avoidance [@Pinones2016]. Their life cycle is tightly linked to seasonal phytoplankton peaks and their demographic structure reflects environmental variability during early stages [@Perry2019; @Cox2011], showing physiological plasticity, such as shrinking and metabolic depression, enables survival during food-limited periods [@Shao2023]. Oxygen availability is another driver that limits aerobic metabolism, and warming oceans are experiencing deoxygenation [@Isensee2016; @IPCC2014]. These combined stressors are narrowing the thermal and metabolic tolerance windows of marine ectotherms, likely affecting biomass and productivity patterns [@Deutsch2015]. In another hand, large-scale climate drivers like the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence krill dynamics by altering sea temperature, ice extent, and primary productivity [@Marshall2018; @Saba2014]. Positive SAM phases enhance diatom productivity and affect krill population structure [@Saba2014]. ENSO cycles introduce irregular variability, and climate change-induced desacoupling of these cycles may disrupt the alignment between environmental optima and krill biology [@Morley2020; @Carrasco2018]. The linkage between species’ biological and population processes and environmental drivers has been conceptualized through the *Match/Mismatch Hypothesis* [@Cushing1990; @Cushing1995; @Planque2010]. This hypothesis posits that variability in the timing of plankton production, itself driven by environmental conditions, leads to fluctuations in larval mortality and ultimately in year-class strength. While the broad impacts of climate variability on marine organisms are increasingly recognized, the specific mechanisms by which environmental forcing shapes krill physiology, behavior, and population structure remain insufficiently understood.

## Trophic interactions and ecosystem role

Antarctic krill serve as the primary link between primary producers and higher trophic levels in the S0 [@Pallin2023; @Reisinger2022; @McBride2021; @Constable2011]. The species exhibits omnivorous feeding behavior, consuming phytoplankton, particularly diatoms, as well as copepods, protozoans, and detrital material [@Reiss2016]. This flexible feeding strategy allows krill to exploit diverse food sources and adapt to seasonal and spatial variations in prey availability. Krill populations exhibit complex predator-prey relationships with numerous Antarctic species. Baleen whales, particularly blue, fin, humpback, and minke whales, depend heavily on krill aggregations for feeding, with some species consuming several tons of krill daily during the feeding season [@Baines2022; @Biuw2024; @Savoca2024]. On the other hand, reproductive aspects of whales, such as pregnancy and calving rates, have also been linked to krill availability in the WAP [@Pallin2023]. 

The Antarctic food web also includes numerous seabird species, including adélie (*Pygoscelis adeliae*), chinstrap (*Pygoscelis antarctica*), and gentoo (*Pygoscelis papua*) penguins, which rely on krill as a primary food source during breeding seasons [@Emmerson2022; @Kruger2021; @Gallagher2023; @Hinke2017]. Fluctuations in krill availability have direct implications for the breeding success and population dynamics of these penguin species [@Salmeron2023; @Kruger2019; @Hinke2017]. Reduced krill abundance, whether due to environmental changes or fishing pressure, can lead to lower chick survival rates, reduced fledging success, and ultimately, decreased reproductive output. Long-term variability in krill supply has also been associated with changes in colony size, particularly in the WAP, where penguin colonies have shown contrasting trends in response to localized shifts in prey accessibility [@Dunn2019a; @Salmeron2023; @Hinke2017; @Trivelpiece2011a]. These food web changes both reflect and are driven by krill population dynamics, resulting in cascading effects that influence predator populations and alter energy flow throughout the ecosystem [@Emmerson2022]. 

## Spatial structure of krill in WAP

Antarctic krill exhibits a circumpolar distribution with distinct regional population structures, characterized by large-scale spawning aggregations and extensive horizontal migrations that can span thousands of kilometers [@Krafft2021; @Atkinson2008; @Atkinson2022; @McBride2021]. Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques have revealed complex spatial population structure throughout the Southern Ocean [@Shao2023], with significant genetic differentiation between populations separated by major oceanographic features, indicating limited gene flow and potential local adaptation. The genetic structure exhibits hierarchical patterns, with pronounced differentiation at large scales between ocean sectors (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian) and, at the WAP scale, notable differences between populations in the WAP and the Scotia Sea. 

Within the WAP, krill display pronounced spatial heterogeneity, forming dense swarms that vary in size, composition, and persistence along environmental gradients [@McBride2021; @SantaCruz2022; @Warwick-Evans2022]. These swarms are especially prominent during the austral summer (December to March), coinciding with peak phytoplankton productivity, and can span hundreds of square kilometers, comprising billions of individuals, among the largest animal aggregations on Earth [@Saba2014; @Pinones2016; @Atkinson2019; @McBride2021]. The formation and distribution of these aggregations are strongly influenced by oceanographic features, sea ice dynamics, predator distribution, and primary production patterns. Adult krill undertake extensive horizontal migrations linking spatially distinct feeding, spawning, and overwintering habitats [@Siegel2013; @Constable2023], driven by both active swimming and passive transport by ocean currents, potentially completing multiple seasonal circuits within their 5–7 year lifespan [@Reiss2016; @McBride2021]. Recent flux water studies have revealed previously unknown migratory corridors and sharp seasonal declines in biomass, highlighting the dynamic nature of krill transport and spatial distribution [@Cutter2022]. 

In recent years, studies in the WAP have documented shifts in the latitudinal distribution of krill swarms, with krill increasingly concentrated in a few key areas, particularly around the Bransfield and Gerlache Straits [@Atkinson2019; @SantaCruz2022]. These shifts are linked to changes in local climatic conditions and have direct implications for the fishery, as harvesting activity becomes concentrated in these limited areas, raising concerns about sustainability and local depletion. 

Understanding the spatial structure of krill is therefore critical not only for interpreting predator–prey dynamics, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning but also for realistic population modeling and effective fisheries management. In this thesis, spatial heterogeneity is treated as a central axis for representing krill population dynamics, as it directly influences recruitment, mortality, migration, and local depletion, all of which can bias model outcomes if ignored or oversimplified.

## Krill fishery and CCAMLR management context

Antarctic krill has sustained a targeted industrial fishery for more than four decades [@Atkinson2019; @Atkinson2022; @Constable2023; @McBride2021; @Chavez_Molina2023]. In particular, the WAP has emerged as the spatial core of this fishery, due to both high krill biomass and seasonal accessibility [@Atkinson2019; @Perry2019; @Veytia2021]. These fishing grounds overlap significantly with critical foraging areas for krill-dependent predators, creating potential for ecological interactions and competition [@Warwick-Evans2022]. Adding, in recent years, the WAP has become a major hotspot of fishing activity, reinforcing the urgency of adopting management strategies that extend beyond single-species approaches. The ecological sensitivity of the region further underscores the need for robust, precautionary management.

To address this need, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) was established in 1982 as part of the international framework set forth by the Antarctic Treaty System [@Tratado1959] (Article IX, paragraph 1, f) and has become the principal international body overseeing conservation and rational use of Antarctic marine resources. The Convention is one of the key components of the Antarctic Treaty System, which provides a comprehensive governance structure for the protection and sustainable use of Antarctica and its surrounding marine ecosystems. Article II of the Convention outlines its primary objective: the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. To achieve this, the Convention mandates that harvesting activities must follow key conservation principles, including: (1) preventing harvested populations from declining below levels that support stable recruitment; (2) maintaining ecological relationships among harvested species and their dependent or associated populations, and facilitating the recovery of depleted stocks; and (3) avoiding or minimizing the risk of ecosystem changes that may not be reversible within two to three decades. From the outset, CCAMLR has promoted a precautionary, ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, explicitly recognizing the central role of krill in supporting dependent predators such as penguins, seals, and whales. Although the krill fishery is managed under a precautionary framework, it remains imperfect [@Hill2019; @Watters2013] and contains several components that warrant refinement to achieve genuinely sustainable and ecosystem-resilient management. 

Krill fishery primarily targets for the production of krill meal, krill oil, and direct human consumption products [@McBride2021].  The most of krill catch is taken by countries like Norway, South Korea, Ukraine and China under an "Olympic-style" fishery system, where no quotas are assigned to specific countries or vessels. Other nations, including Japan, Chile, and occasionally Russia and Japan, also contribute to the fishery [@CCAMLR2024].  Between 10 and 15 vessels are currently active in the fishery, employing sophisticated technologies to maximize catches over short timeframes. The fishery operates primarily during the austral summer months when krill form dense surface swarms that are accessible to fishing vessels [@CCAMLR2024]. However, this seasonality has shifted in recent years due to sea ice retreat and improvements in vessel technology, which now allow krill harvesting even during winter months [@SantaCruz2022]. The current management system includes overall catch limits, spatial restrictions, and with a a fishing season begins on 1 December and finishes on 30 November of the following year designed to minimize impacts on krill-dependent predators and ecosystem functioning [@CCAMLR2021a]. The total allowable catch for the Southwest Atlantic sector, which includes the WAP region, is set at 5.61 million tons annually [@CCAMLR2010], though actual catches have historically been much lower [@CCAMLR2024] due the *trigger level*, which is set at 620,000 tonnes for the entire Area 48, where the objective is ensure that sufficient krill remains available for ecological functions and the needs of dependent predators within the ecosystem [@CCAMLR2010]. Over the past decade, fishing pressure on krill has intensified, with some seasons reaching unprecedented levels of extraction. Notably, during the 2024/2025 season, the entire precautionary trigger level was harvested by mid-year—an historical milestone that reflects both increased efficiency in the fleet and the growing commercial interest in the species.

Nowadyas, the spatial and temporal distribution of krill fishing activities in the WAP region is concentrated in areas of high krill biomass, particularly around the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula itself [@SantaCruz2022; @Kawaguchi2023]. These fishing grounds overlap significantly with critical feeding areas for krill-dependent predators, creating potential for ecological interactions and competition [@Warwick-Evans2022]. In response to escalating pressures and the compounding effects of climate change on krill dynamics, CCAMLR has moved toward a new spatially explicit management strategy starting in 48.1 Subarea. This framework incorporates small-scale management units (SSMUs) to better distribute fishing effort and control outputs (allocations) across the space, aiming to reduce localized depletion and minimize ecological risks in predator-foraging areas. These reforms reflect an evolving understanding that krill management must be spatially and ecologically nuanced. Given these developments, contributing to the decision-making process with the best available science is more critical than ever. Advancing research on integrated models in krill population dynamics, predator-prey interactions, and ecosystem responses to fishing is essential for strengthening CCAMLR's adaptive management framework and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the krill fishery and the broader Antarctic ecosystem.


## Aims of this thesis

The overarching aim of this thesis is to deepen the understanding of Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) population dynamics and fishery across multiple spatial and temporal scales within the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Also, this work seeks to integrate diverse sources of information—ranging from environmental indicators to fishery (dependent and independent data) into a cohesive scientific framework, using advanced methodologies at the cutting-edge of modern fisheries science. By doing so, the thesis contributes not only to fundamental ecological knowledge, but also to the development of practical tools that support more informed, precautionary and adaptive decision-making. A central motivation behind this research is to respond to the growing need for robust, science-based management under the complex and evolving conditions of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. This thesis embraces that complexity rather than simplifying it, using integrated models and management strategy evaluations (MSEs) to explore how uncertainty in recruitment, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental forcing can be reflected in stock assessments outputs and harvest control rules. 

This thesis follows a multidimensional approach structured around six interconnected components, which are addressed in the descriptions of the following chapters. [Chapter 1](#chap1) provides a comprehensive introduction to krill biology, ecosystem role, and the current state of knowledge regarding population dynamics and fishery in the WAP region. These aspects will be taken into account in the implementation of stock assessment models, as will be discussed in the following chapters. [Chapter 2](#chap2) assesses the environmental drivers influencing krill population dynamics, examining how these variables, including sea ice extent, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations, affect krill recruitment and populations processes. [Chapter 3](#chap3) explores spatial heterogeneity in krill population dynamics throughout the WAP region, analyzing how local environmental conditions and habitat characteristics create distinct conditions signals of population status at spatial scale. This chapter identifies key areas of low potential reproductive index and management implications. [Chapter 4](#chap4) presents a comprehensive stock assessment using an integrated length-to-age model approach, incorporating multiple data sources including fishery-independent surveys, commercial catch data, and ecosystems (environmental and predator) components. This modeling framework provides estimates of krill biomass, recruitment variability, and population trends while accounting for uncertainty in different components, like, growth, selectivity,  parameters. [Chapter 5](#chap5) conducts a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the krill fishery with a short cut approach, testing the performance of different management procedures under various scenarios of recruitment and fishing pressure. This chapter evaluates the current and alternative harvest control rules and adaptive management strategies to identify robust approaches for sustainable krill fishery management in the face of uncertainty. [Chapter 6](#chap6) synthesizes findings from previous chapters to provide an integrated perspective on krill population dynamics and fishery sustainability. This discussion evaluates the implications of spatial and temporal variability for management strategies, assesses the performance of different modeling approaches, and provides recommendations for conservation measures and future research. 

Ultimately, the purpose of this thesis is to contribute to the ongoing efforts of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), particularly in the fragile ecosystem context along the WAP, by offering scientific insight and practical evaluation tools that can help guide sustainable krill fishery management.
