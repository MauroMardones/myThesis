# Abstract {-}

This document presents a doctoral thesis focused on understanding the population dynamics of Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) and its associated fishery through a multidimensional approach. The main objective is to support decision-making processes by applying cutting-edge methodologies and scientific frameworks at the forefront of modern marine and fisheries science. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of krill population dynamics, fishing activity, and their ecosystem context in the Western Antarctic Peninsula, the thesis is structured around four interconnected components: the analysis of environmental and ecosystem relationships with krill populations; the characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of population dynamics; the integration of stock assessment processes using multiple data sources; and the evaluation of harvest control rules currently applied in krill fishery management. The following chapters address each of these dimensions.  [Chapter 1](#chap1) provides a comprehensive introduction to krill biology, ecosystem role, and the current state of knowledge regarding population dynamics and fishery in the WAP region. [Chapter 2](#chap2) investigates the ecosystem drivers influencing krill population dynamics, examining how environmental variables including sea ice extent, ocean temperature, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and climate indices affect krill abundance and distribution patterns. [Chapter 3](#chap3) explores spatial heterogeneity in krill population dynamics throughout the WAP region, analyzing how local environmental conditions and habitat characteristics create distinct conditions signals of population status in a spatial context. This chapter identifies key areas of low potential reprodutive index and management implications. [Chapter 4](#chap4) presents a comprehensive stock assessment using an integrated length-to-age model approach, incorporating multiple data sources including fishery-independent surveys, commercial catch data, and ecosystems components. This modeling framework provides estimates of krill biomass, recruitment variability, and population trends while accounting for uncertainty in different components, like, growth, selectivity,  parameters. [Chapter 5](#chap5) conducts a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the krill fishery wit a short cut approach, testing the performance of different management procedures under various scenarios of recruitment and fishing pressure. This chapter evaluates the current and alternative harvest control rules and adaptive management strategies to identify robust approaches for sustainable krill fishery management in the face of uncertainty. [Chapter 6](#chap6) synthesizes findings from previous chapters to provide an integrated perspective on krill population dynamics and fishery sustainability. This discussion evaluates the implications of spatial and temporal variability for management strategies, assesses the performance of different modeling approaches, and provides recommendations for future research and management protocols. This thesis advances scientific understanding of Antarctic krill population dynamics while offering practical tools for the development of sustainable fishery management strategies. It emphasizes the importance of integrating ecological considerations into decision-making processes, particularly in the fragile ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and, more specifically, along the Western Antarctic Peninsula.

The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) represents one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing marine ecosystems on Earth [REF], serving as a critical habitat for Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*), a keystone species that forms the foundation of the Southern Ocean food web [REF]. This euphausiid crustacean exhibits complex population dynamics that are intrinsically linked to oceanographic processes, climate variability, and anthropogenic pressures, making it a species of paramount ecological and commercial importance [REF]. *Euphausia superba* exhibits remarkable biological complexity that underlies its ecological success in the harsh Antarctic environment. The species demonstrates a circumpolar distribution with distinct regional population structures, characterized by large-scale spawning aggregations and extensive horizontal migrations that can span thousands of kilometers [REF]. The life cycle of Antarctic krill is intricately adapted to the seasonal ice dynamics of the Southern Ocean, with spawning occurring primarily during the austral summer months when phytoplankton productivity peaks [REF]. 

The demographic structure of krill populations reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with recruitment success heavily dependent on environmental conditions during critical early life stages [REF]. Larval development follows a complex pattern involving multiple molting stages, from nauplii through various zoeal and furcilia stages before reaching juvenile and adult forms [REF]. This extended developmental period, lasting up to two years, creates substantial variability in year-class strength and population stability [REF].

Krill exhibit sophisticated behavioral adaptations including diel vertical migration patterns, where individuals migrate vertically through the water column in response to light levels, predator avoidance, and feeding opportunities [REF]. These migrations can extend over several hundred meters, facilitating the transport of nutrients and energy between different ocean layers and contributing to the biological pump [REF]. The species also demonstrates remarkable physiological plasticity, including the ability to shrink during food-limited periods and to survive extended periods of starvation through metabolic depression [REF].

Reproductive strategies in *E. superba* show considerable flexibility, with females capable of multiple spawning events during favorable seasons and the ability to reabsorb developing eggs during adverse conditions [REF]. Population growth rates are highly variable, influenced by factors including food availability, temperature, sea ice extent, and predation pressure [REF]. Recent studies have identified genetic population structure across the Southern Ocean, suggesting limited gene flow between regional populations and potential local adaptation to environmental conditions [REF].

## Ecosystem Relationships and Trophic Dynamics

Antarctic krill occupies a pivotal position in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, serving as the primary link between primary producers and higher trophic levels [REF]. The species exhibits omnivorous feeding behavior, consuming phytoplankton, particularly diatoms, as well as copepods, protozoans, and detrital material [REF]. This flexible feeding strategy allows krill to exploit diverse food sources and adapt to seasonal and spatial variations in prey availability [REF].

The relationship between krill and sea ice represents one of the most critical ecosystem interactions in the Antarctic. Sea ice provides essential habitat for krill through multiple mechanisms: it serves as a feeding ground where krill graze on ice-associated algae, provides refuge from predators, and creates favorable conditions for reproduction and larval development [REF]. The under-ice environment supports distinct microbial communities that form the base of the ice-associated food web, with krill playing a central role in transferring energy from this primary production to the broader ecosystem [REF].

Krill populations exhibit complex predator-prey relationships with numerous Antarctic species. Baleen whales, particularly blue, fin, humpback, and minke whales, depend heavily on krill aggregations for feeding, with some species consuming several tons of krill daily during the feeding season [REF]. Crabeater seals, despite their name, are specialized krill predators with morphological adaptations for filtering krill from the water [REF]. The Antarctic food web also includes numerous seabird species, including Adélie, chinstrap, and gentoo penguins, which rely on krill as a primary food source during breeding seasons [REF].

The ecosystem role of krill extends beyond direct trophic interactions to include significant biogeochemical functions. Through their vertical migrations and excretion, krill contribute to nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in the Southern Ocean [REF]. Their fecal pellets represent a major pathway for carbon export to deep waters, while their molting and mortality contribute to the particulate organic matter pool [REF].

Climate change impacts on the WAP ecosystem are manifesting through alterations in krill population dynamics and distribution patterns. Rising temperatures, changes in sea ice extent and duration, and shifts in ocean chemistry are affecting krill habitat quality and prey availability [REF]. These environmental changes have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem, influencing predator populations and altering energy flow pathways [REF].

## Spatial structure of krill in WAP

Understanding the spatial structure of Antarctic krill in the Western Antarctic Peninsula is essential for both ecological insight and effective fishery management. Krill in this region exhibit marked spatial heterogeneity, forming dense aggregations—known as swarms—that vary in size, composition, and persistence across environmental gradients [REF, REF, REF]. In some areas, exceptionally large and concentrated super swarms are observed, which can extend over several kilometers and represent critical hotspots of biomass. These structures are not random; they are shaped by local oceanography, sea ice dynamics, predator presence, and primary productivity. This spatial complexity means that krill are not evenly available to predators or the fishery, and that localized depletion—even if temporary—can have disproportionate ecological consequences, particularly in predator-dependent areas. By analyzing spatial patterns of swarming behavior, along with environmental drivers and biological indicators, this thesis aims to improve the resolution and realism of stock assessments and to support spatially explicit management measures. Recognizing and incorporating the spatial scale at which krill aggregate—especially super swarm dynamics—offers a more accurate representation of the population, and aligns management strategies with the biological and ecological reality of the system.

## Fishery Implications and CCAMLR Management Context

The commercial exploitation of Antarctic krill has evolved into a significant fishery with important implications for ecosystem management and conservation. The krill fishery in the Southern Ocean, including the WAP region, operates under the regulatory framework of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which implements an ecosystem-based management approach [REF]. This fishery primarily targets krill for the production of krill meal, krill oil, and direct human consumption products, with annual catches reaching several hundred thousand tons [REF].

The spatial and temporal distribution of krill fishing activities in the WAP region is concentrated in areas of high krill biomass, particularly around the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula itself [REF]. These fishing grounds overlap significantly with critical feeding areas for krill-dependent predators, creating potential for ecological interactions and competition [REF]. The fishery operates primarily during the austral summer months when krill form dense surface swarms that are accessible to fishing vessels [REF].

CCAMLR's management framework for the krill fishery is based on the precautionary approach and ecosystem-based management principles, recognizing the central role of krill in the Antarctic ecosystem [REF]. The current management system includes overall catch limits, spatial restrictions, and seasonal closures designed to minimize impacts on krill-dependent predators and ecosystem functioning [REF]. The total allowable catch for the Southwest Atlantic sector, which includes the WAP region, is set at 5.61 million tons annually, though actual catches have historically been much lower [REF].

Recent developments in krill fishery management include the implementation of fine-scale management measures that distribute fishing effort both spatially and temporally to reduce concentration of fishing activities in sensitive areas [REF]. These measures aim to maintain krill availability for predators while allowing sustainable commercial exploitation [REF]. The management system also incorporates real-time monitoring of fishing activities and ecosystem indicators to adaptive management responses [REF].

The sustainability of krill fisheries in the context of climate change presents significant challenges for management. Projected changes in krill distribution and abundance due to environmental variability require adaptive management strategies that can respond to ecosystem changes [REF]. The development of management procedures that incorporate climate variability and ecosystem indicators represents an ongoing priority for CCAMLR [REF].

Future research priorities for krill population dynamics and fishery management in the WAP region include improved understanding of population connectivity, climate change impacts on recruitment success, and the development of ecosystem models that can predict krill population responses to environmental change [REF]. These research needs are critical for maintaining the sustainability of both the krill fishery and the broader Antarctic ecosystem in the face of ongoing environmental change [REF].

The integration of traditional fisheries science with ecosystem-based management approaches represents a paradigm shift in how krill populations are managed, recognizing their fundamental role in ecosystem functioning and the need for precautionary management in the face of uncertainty [REF]. This approach acknowledges that the management of krill populations must consider not only the sustainability of the target species but also the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and the conservation of dependent species [REF].


## Aims of this thesis

The overarching aim of this thesis is to deepen the understanding of Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) population dynamics and fishery across multiple spatial and temporal scales within the Western Antarctic Peninsula. This work seeks to integrate diverse sources of information—ranging from environmental indicators to fishery-dependent and independent data—into a cohesive scientific framework, using advanced methodologies at the cutting edge of modern fisheries science. By doing so, the thesis contributes not only to fundamental ecological knowledge, but also to the development of practical tools that support more informed, precautionary and adaptive decision-making. A central motivation behind this research is to respond to the growing need for robust, science-based management under the complex and evolving conditions of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The WAP is currently experiencing rapid environmental change, with shifts in sea ice dynamics, ocean temperatures, and predator distributions—all of which influence krill population structure, availability, and fishery interactions. This thesis embraces that complexity rather than simplifying it, using integrated models and management strategy evaluations (MSEs) to explore how uncertainty in recruitment, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental forcing can be reflected in harvest control rules and stock assessments. Ultimately, the purpose of this research is to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing efforts of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), by offering scientific insight and practical evaluation tools that can help guide sustainable krill fishery management. It is driven by a strong belief that decision-making must be anchored in the best available science—science that is both technically rigorous and ecologically informed. In this way, the thesis aims not only to protect the krill resource itself, but also to support the broader integrity and resilience of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.
