### About Aims

It is driven by a strong belief that decision-making must be anchored in the best available science—science that is both technically rigorous and ecologically informed. In this way, the thesis aims not only to protect the krill resource itself, but also to support the broader integrity and resilience of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.

> By integrating diverse data sources, including fishery operations, biological characteristics, spatiotemporal population dynamics, and key ecosystem drivers, the model strengthens the scientific foundation for sustainable management aligned with CCAMLR's ecosystem-based management objectives .

### Abput Management


 The management system also incorporates real-time monitoring of fishing activities and ecosystem indicators to adaptive management responses [REF]. The sustainability of krill fisheries in the context of climate change presents significant challenges for management. Projected changes in krill distribution and abundance due to environmental variability require adaptive management strategies that can respond to ecosystem changes [REF]. The development of management procedures that incorporate climate variability and ecosystem indicators represents an ongoing priority for CCAMLR [REF]. Future research priorities for krill population dynamics and fishery management in the WAP region include improved understanding of population connectivity, climate change impacts on recruitment success, and the development of ecosystem models that can predict krill population responses to environmental change [REF]. These research needs are critical for maintaining the sustainability of both the krill fishery and the broader Antarctic ecosystem in the face of ongoing environmental change [REF].

The integration of traditional fisheries science with ecosystem-based management approaches represents a paradigm shift in how krill populations are managed, recognizing their fundamental role in ecosystem functioning and the need for precautionary management in the face of uncertainty [REF]. This approach acknowledges that the management of krill populations must consider not only the sustainability of the target species but also the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and the conservation of dependent species [REF].

### about integrated models

This finding underscores that single-species stock assessment approaches can be substantially enhanced in their biological realism when environmental covariates are incorporated into the modelling framework.

### About Evironmental

The observed interannual variability in chlorophyll concentrations, particularly the pronounced anomalies in 2003, 2011, 2016, and 2020, correspond to documented periods of environmental change in the Western Antarctic Peninsula region [@Veytia2020; @Ryabov2023; @Pinkerton2021].

Ultimately, this contributes to stock assessments that are more robust and responsive to environmental change in this kind of species.


### Broader Implications for Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management

This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the integration of ecosystem considerations into stock assessment frameworks. The demonstrated sensitivity of krill population estimates to environmental and predator variables underscores the importance of ecosystem-based approaches for managing marine resources in rapidly changing environments (REF). The methodological framework developed here provides a template for similar applications in other ecosystems where multiple data sources and ecological interactions must be integrated to inform management decisions.

The challenges encountered in balancing model complexity with statistical robustness reflect broader issues in ecosystem-based fisheries management. While the incorporation of ecological realism is essential for long-term sustainability, practical management applications require models that are scientifically credible, computationally tractable, and capable of providing reliable advice under uncertainty (REF).


(CONCLUSION from chapter 3)

This study undertakes the first analysis of the intrinsic productivity of krill in Subarea 48.1 using the quantitative method Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR) which proved to be a useful tool to assess the influence of multiple stressors on the spatial variability of krill intrinsic productivity while elucidating the environmental drivers of growth and reproductive processes. This approach also provided a robust method to measure temporal trends in spatially-explicit population status relative to limit and target biological reference points. These spatio-temporal variations in intrinsic productivity serve as a fundamental basis as a management procedure, which seeks to integrate the complexities of krill population dynamics into a framework aligned with CCAMLR revised management strategy for Subarea 48.1. The proposed HCR aligns with the revised scheme, and given the absence of biologically-based allocation of catch across strata in the WAP, it would serve well to inform the meaningful allocation of current catch limits in the region, and in turn, contributes to a paradigm shift towards a spatially explicit management scheme. By aligning fishing practices with the natural flows of krill productivity, this approach lays the foundation for a useful coexistence between fishing harvesting and the Antarctic ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the sustainability of this vital element of the Southern Ocean.


It is driven by a strong belief that decision-making must be anchored in the best available science—science that is both technically rigorous and ecologically informed. In this way, the thesis aims not only to protect the krill resource itself, but also to support the broader integrity and resilience of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.

CONCLUSION Chp 4


The results demonstrate that ecosystem-informed models provide a more biologically realistic representation of krill population processes, albeit with increased structural complexity and statistical challenges that warrant careful consideration for management applications

This study demonstrates that ecosystem-informed stock assessment models can provide more biologically realistic representations of Antarctic krill population dynamics, albeit with increased complexity and statistical challenges. The integration of environmental and predator variables resulted in more conservative and arguably more appropriate estimates of stock status, supporting CCAMLR's precautionary management approach. However, the observed trade-offs between ecological realism and statistical performance highlight the need for continued model development and validation to ensure that ecosystem-based assessments can reliably inform management decisions.

Future research should focus on refining the representation of ecosystem processes, addressing temporal and spatial scale mismatches, and developing robust approaches for managing the inherent uncertainties in ecosystem-informed models. The continued collaboration between stock assessment scientists, ecosystem researchers, and fisheries managers will be essential for advancing the science and practice of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the Antarctic and beyond.

The framework presented here represents an important step toward achieving CCAMLR's objectives for ecosystem-based management of Antarctic marine living resources. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of incorporating ecosystem considerations into stock assessment frameworks justify continued investment in this research direction, particularly given the rapid environmental changes occurring in the Antarctic region.

The integration of ecosystem variables, such as penguin predation and environmental conditions, significantly enhances the accuracy of krill population dynamics models by capturing complex and time-varying ecological processes. This approach provides a more realistic reflection of fluctuations in krill biomass and recruitment. The results emphasize that environmental conditions, particularly primary productivity, directly affect krill recruitment dynamics, highlighting the importance of considering climate variability in the sustainability of krill fisheries, especially in light of global climate change. Furthermore, predation by species like penguins plays a crucial role in the natural mortality of krill, and including this factor in the models improves estimates of natural mortality, offering a more accurate assessment of krill population health, which is vital for sustainable management. Ecosystem-informed models, while providing more biologically accurate projections, tend to produce more conservative and less optimistic estimates compared to traditional models. This helps mitigate the risk of overestimations that could lead to unsustainable management decisions. However, these models also introduce challenges such as increased sensitivity and retrospective bias, particularly in fishing mortality estimates, underscoring the need for a balance between ecological realism and model stability to ensure reliable management decisions.

Overall, these findings reinforce that integrated models within an ecosystem-based approach provide a stronger scientific foundation for krill fishery management. However, this work represents a preliminary effort that must continue to be refined and strengthened through feedback and collaboration within the Antarctic scientific community. Disseminating and discussing these results will be essential for improving ecosystem-based modeling approaches and enhancing their utility in future management strategies.

The incorporation of environmentally-explicit recruitment relationships into integrated assessment frameworks represents a significant advancement in our ability to capture the mechanistic drivers underlying krill population dynamics. By moving beyond purely empirical stock-recruitment relationships, this approach enables more realistic projections of population responses to environmental change, which is particularly crucial for a species that serves as a keystone component of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.


<!-- One critical issue concerns the dependence on direct biomass estimates, which are typically derived from expensive and logistically demanding scientific surveys—most notably acoustic campaigns. These surveys, while highly informative, are methodologically complex and costly to repeat with sufficient temporal resolution. Furthermore, differences in survey design, calibration, and analytical protocols between campaigns introduce variability and uncertainty into biomass estimates, complicating their interpretation and use in long-term management decisions. On the other hand, CCAMLR currently employs a management framework that uses an indirect model called General Yield Model (GRYM) [REF]. This model approach assumes stable environmental conditions—a premise that increasingly fails to hold true in the context of ongoing climate change [REF]. GRYM, while useful for certain data-poor applications, faces difficulties due to its heavy dependence on life history parameters, such as growth rates, harvest strategies, and natural mortality. Moreover, the assumption of stable environmental conditions in such models is problematic [REF], as climate variability significantly influences the productivity and survival. As a result, predictions based on GRYM and similar models become less reliable, particularly in the face of changing environmental conditions or ecological considerations. This highlights the need made a transition to a **more realistic** for a integrated model and ecosystem-informed approaches to stock assessment that consider the evolving nature of environmental and ecological drivers, such as changes in sea ice extent, primary productivity, and predator-prey interactions. -->

<!-- There is now broad scientific consensus on the need for stock assessment models that incorporate multiple data sources, capture temporal and spatial variability, and account for ecosystem interactions. However, integrating these complexities presents several challenges. Long-term data consistency is often lacking due to variations in monitoring programs and sampling methodologies. Additionally, some areas have sparse or incomplete datasets on krill dynamics. Furthermore, indirect drivers, such as environmental variability and predator abundance, introduce another layer of complexity. Despite these gaps, a substantial amount of data exists on krill populations and their ecosystem, making it crucial to identify knowledge gaps and integrate available information into comprehensive models that support management recommendations.  -->

<!-- The transition from traditional, model-based approaches like GRYM to more integrated, ecosystem-based models presents a significant opportunity to improve the scientific basis of krill stock assessments. However, this shift also requires addressing the trade-offs between model complexity and data availability [REF]. While integrated models offer a more holistic view of krill population dynamics by incorporating ecosystem variables, they also introduce new challenges related to the accuracy and reliability of model inputs. Thus, the development of integrated models requires continuous refinement to ensure that they remain relevant and robust in the face of change in various dimensions [REF]. -->

<!-- By integrating ecosystem drivers into the stock assessment process, this study aims to demonstrate how incorporating environmental and ecological factors enhances the accuracy of Antarctic krill population estimates and improves the ability to predict future stock trends under changing climate and ecological conditions in a realistic way. This perspective seeks to strengthen the scientific foundation for sustainable management recommendations, ensuring that krill harvesting strategies align with CCAMLR’s ecosystem-based management approach. Management strategies should incorporate ecosystem-based thresholds informed by environmental and predation dynamics, as these factors are critical in maintaining krill availability for predators, which is essential for overall ecosystem balance. Additionally, the ongoing warming in the WAP highlights the urgent need to integrate climate-driven changes into habitat suitability models, ensuring that management approaches remain adaptive to shifting environmental conditions. Ultimately, the insights gained from this integrated modeling effort contribute to CCAMLR’s ongoing strategy to balance the sustainability of the krill fishery with the conservation of the broader Antarctic marine ecosystem, supporting both the species that depend on krill as a primary food source and the long-term resilience of the Southern Ocean. -->


<!-- Although integrated models are not new to krill in the Southern Ocean, CCAMLR has for years applied methodologies that incorporate diverse data sources for several years. External reviews, such as @Thomson2016, have endorsed these approaches as improvements over traditional models. Previous studies like @Kinzey2011, @Kinzey2015, @Kinzey2019, and @Wang2021 have advanced integrated frameworks, though challenges like model convergence remain. -->

<!-- This analysis represents a modern approach to stock assessment of complex dynamics such as krill, integrating ecosystem components like environmental variables and ecological aspects such as predators. Integrated stock assessment models can support adaptive management, wherein outputs like status or quotas are adjusted based on ecosystem monitoring indices [REF] -->


<!-- Spatial heterogeneity is a fundamental aspect of krill ecology, driven by factors including oceanographic conditions and predator foraging behavior. Incorporating strata into our model captures complex spatial patterns of krill distribution, enabling identification of hotspots, productivity zones, and ecological corridors. [REF] -->

<!-- These progressive increments in parameter numbers reflect the added ecological realism and mechanistic detail captured in each scenario, emphasizing the role of top-down and bottom-up processes in krill dynamics. -->

<!-- Tabla summary -->

<!-- The analysis suggests that incorporating environmental variables (s1.3 and s1.4) improves model fit and predictive accuracy, particularly when compared to predator-only models. The model that includes only environmental covariates (s1.3) strikes the best balance between fit quality, complexity, and retrospective performance, suggesting that environmental variability is a key driver of krill population dynamics in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. -->

<!-- In contrast, the inclusion of predators alone (s1.2) leads to poorer model fit and higher retrospective bias, possibly due to data limitations or unaccounted complexity in predator-prey dynamics. While the full ecosystem model (s1.4) shows some improvements over the predator-only model, it still exhibits significant retrospective biases, highlighting the need for refined integration of ecosystem components and further data support, particularly regarding predator consumption rates and spatial foraging behavior. -->

<!-- Overall, the results support the conclusion that ecosystem-informed models better capture the temporal and size-structured dynamics of krill, with the joint inclusion of predator and environmental variables yielding the most robust representation of observed length compositions. The inclusion of environmental covariates (s1.3 and s1.4) markedly improves the temporal independence of model residuals, as indicated by lower autocorrelation beyond lag 1. This implies that environmental variability contributes significantly to explaining observed trends in krill population dynamics. Conversely, the predator-only model (s1.2) introduces more persistent autocorrelation, indicating that its effects may require more nuanced representation or additional process structuring.  -->

<!-- The analysis indicates that incorporating environmental and predator data into the stock assessment framework introduces greater variability in model fit, as measured by RMSE. While the baseline model (Model 1.1) demonstrates more stable performance, it potentially achieves this at the cost of biological realism. The modest trade-off in predictive accuracy associated with ecosystem-informed models is expected and highlights the need to balance goodness-of-fit with ecological plausibility when developing integrated assessment models. -->

<!-- The inclusion of predator and environmental variables significantly alters model behavior in retrospective diagnostics, particularly increasing bias in terminal-year estimates of fishing mortality and deepening the underestimation of spawning stock biomass (SSB). These patterns suggest that while ecosystem-informed models improve the biological realism of the stock assessment, they also pose challenges in terms of stability and predictive consistency. Such outcomes underline the importance of further refining the structure and parameterization of ecosystem components when integrating them into assessment frameworks, to balance realism with diagnostic robustness. -->

<!-- Likelihood composition reveals that models incorporating ecological data (s1.2–s1.4) yield slightly lower total likelihoods than the reference model (s1.1), reflecting trade-offs between model fit and biological realism. The reduced penalty terms and more evenly distributed likelihood contributions in the ecosystem scenarios suggest improved model stability and reduced overparameterization. These results reinforce the value of integrating ecosystem variables not only for enhancing ecological interpretation but also for promoting robust model structure and parameter behavior. -->

<!-- ### Ecosystem Variables: krill population dynamics relevance -->


<!-- > regarding clorofila como driver; This is consistent with previous studies that have identified this variable as an important driver of variability in different biological components of the krill population and shaping krill habitat suitability and productivity [REF REF REF]. -->

<!-- >  About index; These patterns suggest substantial year-to-year environmental changes, which may have implications for marine ecosystem productivity and associated trophic dynamics and krill population impacts [REF].  -->

<!-- Variations in krill size composition in penguin diets have been shown to reflect underlying changes in krill population dynamics, including recruitment pulses and cohort strength [Jeff REFs]. Thus, penguin diet data serve as a proxy for detecting cyclical patterns in krill recruitment that may not be evident through direct surveys alone. [REF] -->

<!-- The ecosystem variables used in assessment processes vary from their definition to how they are applied. Environmental variables influencing krill recruitment, as well as predators that introduce an additional component of natural mortality into the model, are among those considered in this study. [REF]  -->

<!-- Marshall et al. (2019) [REF] classify ecosystem variables based on their impact on population dynamics and how they are incorporated into stock assessment models. They suggest that integrating variables, especially recruitment, directly within the model results in a more dynamic and accurate representation of population dynamics, as it captures real-time interactions between ecological factors. In contrast, external incorporation may not fully capture ecosystem feedback loops, potentially leading to less reliable assessments. -->

<!-- Our analysis, which integrates ecosystem variables directly within the model, aligns with the conclusions of Marshall et al. (2019) and provides further evidence that this approach offers superior accuracy in modeling krill population dynamics. By including both environmental drivers and predation pressures within the model, our study captures the complexity of krill dynamics more effectively, offering a more realistic representation of krill biomass, recruitment, and mortality processes. This integrated approach not only improves model precision but also enhances its predictive power, addressing key ecological factors that influence krill populations. -->

<!-- This analysis represents a significant step forward in the incorporation of ecosystem-based considerations into krill stock assessments in the Southern Ocean. By adopting a more comprehensive, ecosystem-informed model, we contribute to the growing body of research supporting the integration of ecosystem variables in stock assessment frameworks [REF]. This approach is consistent with the new and evolving management strategies of the Commission for the CCAMLR, which increasingly emphasizes ecosystem-based management practices. As climate change and ecosystem variability continue to impact krill populations, this analysis provides a foundation for precautionary management strategies that are better aligned with the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems. -->

<!-- Like @Crone2019, the study concluded that both methods for including environmental data resulted in relatively high-quality estimates for a diverse group of output variables. The best performing models were those that included a correct and bias-corrected environmental variable, indicating the importance of accurately incorporating environmental factors in stock assessments -->


<!-- Regarding to evironmental impact in modelliling of main population variables in stock assessment process, @Haltuch2009 recommends that low-frequency environmental variability significantly affects fish population abundance through recruitment, and biomass reference points should be based on average recruitment and/or dynamic B0, especially if comprehensive catch and survey data are available, y a su vez, la calidad y cantidad de datos mejorar la exactitud de resultados.  -->

<!-- Overall, these results highlight the benefit of including environmental signals to reduce residual autocorrelation and enhance model fit. This analysis coincides with... [REF] -->



<!-- ### Predation and Natural Mortality -->

<!-- The study area encompasses the primary spawning, breeding, and wintering regions of Antarctic krill in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Evidence indicates that penguin predation exerts strong top-down control on krill populations. Penguins, as krill specialists, have reproductive success tied closely to krill availability. [REF] -->

<!-- Incorporating predation into stock models addresses the underestimation of uncertainty in natural mortality, which can otherwise skew biomass and productivity estimates by as much as 20% [@Hollowed2000]. -->


<!-- > The three main penguin colonies Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo are central place foragers with diet compositions that are strongly linked to krill abundance and demographic structure, particularly during the breeding season when foraging is spatially and temporally constrained [REF Lucas, REF Vicky].  -->

<!-- > This spatial overlap reinforces the ecological relevance of penguin-based indicators in reflecting krill dynamics  -->

<!-- > variability length; , which may reflect fluctuations in recruitment strength and availability of krill age classes. -->

<!-- Because M2 is a MGparm, it can be time-varying like any other MGparm. This is -->
<!-- important because M2, as a component added to base M, will probably always need to be -->
<!-- time-varying by blocks, random walk or linkage to external driver. (SS3 manual) -->

<!-- @Hollowed2000 demostrate a successful integration of predation mortality into Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock assessments showing that the value of predator data (e.g., diet composition, predator abundance) for refining natural mortality estimates and understanding ecosystem dynamics improve the estimations. Explicit modeling of key predators (e.g., arrowtooth flounder, Steller sea lions) improved biomass estimates by addressing previously unquantified mortality sources, particularly for younger age classes.   -->

<!-- However, reliance on predator data introduces challenges: (1) interannual and age-specific variability in natural mortality (especially for vulnerable stages) requires high-resolution trophic data; (2) dome-shaped selectivity patterns in predators may complicate mortality rate estimation; and (3) gaps in spatiotemporal coverage of predator diets can bias assessments.   -->

<!-- To enhance robustness, future work should prioritize: (1) expanded monitoring of predator diets across seasons, (2) dynamic selectivity models to account for predator behavior, and (3) ecosystem-based frameworks that explicitly link krill dynamics to predator demand and environmental shifts. While predator data significantly reduces uncertainty in mortality estimates, its efficacy depends on systematic data collection and integration into holistic management strategies.   -->



<!-- Inclusion of predator in this analisis coincide with @Moustahfid2009, where they found that explicitly including predation mortality in stock assessment models significantly alters the outputs. When predation was not accounted for, the model underestimated both the magnitude and uncertainty of spawning-stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment levels. -->


<!-- (reflection)  -->

<!-- > Although penguin predation on krill does not reach the magnitude required to decimate the planktonic crustacean population—as might be the case with baleen whales [@Baines2022; @Biuw2024]—it is nevertheless important that stock assessment models incorporate signals regarding the trends of this factor on population variables. Since the index is relative rather than absolute, it provides valuable information for modeling krill population dynamics. -->

<!-- > The substantial variability between consumption estimates presents challenges for model integration. While some studies suggest predators consume approximately 20% of the krill standing stock [@Baines2022], others indicate consumption levels around 20% of the total krill catch [@Biuw2024]. This discrepancy in baseline metrics complicates comparative analysis and requires careful reconciliation when incorporating these estimates into integrated models. -->

<!-- (Talk about decrease in penguins colonies at 2020 an impact in modeling) -->

<!-- The overlap between peak penguin chick-rearing periods and krill availability reinforces the ecological significance of these age classes in sustaining predator populations. Additionally, the extended presence of krill in predator diets across age classes supports the inference of sustained natural mortality beyond early ontogeny. -->

<!-- ### Productivity -->

<!-- Integrating environmental and predator components into the population model (s1.4) substantially affects the shape and variability of the stock–recruitment relationship. The ecosystem-informed model reduces the occurrence of extreme recruitment outliers and yields a more consistent relationship between SSB and recruitment. [REF]. Models that omit ecosystem components tend to produce higher and more uncertain projections, potentially overestimating stock productivity. The inclusion of these variables leads to more conservative and constrained outputs, which may better reflect the ecological dynamics governing krill populations. -->




<!-- > This highlights the critical role of ecosystem components in influencing recruitment and population structure, and their importance in comprehensive stock assessment frameworks for krill. -->

<!-- The inclusion of environmental variables (s1.3 and s1.4) substantially lowers estimates of per-capita productivity, especially at low stock levels. These ecosystem-informed scenarios reflect more realistic ecological constraints and reduce the risk of overestimating krill productivity under unfavorable conditions. This highlights the importance of accounting for environmental drivers in stock assessment models to avoid overly optimistic projections of stock resilience. [REF] -->

<!-- Population variables: Overall, the inclusion of ecosystem and predator data (s1.4) results in more conservative estimates of biomass, recruitment, and spawning stock, suggesting that ecosystem-informed models may provide a more precautionary and ecologically realistic basis for krill stock assessment and management. -->

<!-- CC coments : **"perhaps it is worth haveing another read, and combine some bits of discussion, there’s repetition of highlighting the important of the model and env variables . This is true but there’s  no need of saying it everytime you discuss a parameter"** -->



<!-- > SRR: These patterns reflect a more precautionary and ecologically realistic recruitment dynamic, where environmental variability limits the ability of the stock to maintain high productivity under depleted conditions. Overall, the results emphasize the influence of ecosystem variables on shaping recruitment dynamics and demonstrate that incorporating environmental drivers into the assessment model leads to more conservative productivity estimates, particularly at low spawning biomass levels. -->




<!-- ### Model integrated limitations  -->

<!-- > While the inclusion of ecosystem variables in stock assessment models has gained momentum in recent years, there remains a notable paucity of studies that integrate both predation and environmental forcing within a single modeling framework. This gap may stem from the inherent complexity of disentangling the individual and potentially interactive effects of these covariates, as they are often correlated in space and time. Such confounding can obscure causal relationships, making it difficult to attribute observed changes in population dynamics to specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, methodological limitations and the lack of standardized approaches for simultaneously incorporating multiple ecosystem components have constrained broader implementation. Nevertheless, advancing our understanding of how predation pressure and environmental variability jointly affect stock status is essential for developing robust, ecosystem-informed management strategies. Addressing this challenge requires both conceptual and analytical efforts to adequately represent these dynamics, evaluate their contributions, and quantify associated uncertainties. -->

<!-- (Discussion) -->

<!-- The observed retrospective bias in SSB and F aligns with findings from previous studies on krill population dynamics, where recruitment variability and model structure influence stock assessment estimates (Hill et al., 2016; Watters et al., 2020). The negative bias in SSB suggests that models may overestimate past biomass, potentially due to unaccounted environmental variability or underestimation of natural mortality (Meyer et al., 2021). The positive bias in F indicates a tendency to underestimate past fishing mortality, which could be linked to the inclusion of predator-based indices such as penguin foraging data (Trathan et al., 2018). These results highlight the importance of incorporating ecosystem interactions into stock assessments to improve predictive accuracy and support sustainable management of Antarctic krill. -->

<!-- The study on krill population dynamics presents several limitations that should be acknowledged for a comprehensive understanding of its findings. Here are the key limitations identified: -->

<!-- - Integrating multiple data sources and accounting for temporal and spatial variability in stock assessments presents significant challenges. The study highlights that long-term data consistency is often lacking due to variations in monitoring programs and sampling methodologies, which can affect the robustness of the results . -->

<!-- - While the study emphasizes the importance of incorporating ecosystem variables into stock assessments, it also acknowledges that the models used may not fully capture all relevant interactions within the ecosystem. This could lead to biased estimations of krill population dynamics and stock health . -->

<!-- - The paper mentions that spatial heterogeneity was not fully addressed in the modeling approach (implicit approach). Future research is suggested to incorporate spatially explicit models, which were not utilized in this study. This limitation may affect the understanding of how krill populations are distributed and managed across different regions . -->

<!-- -  The retrospective analysis conducted in the study indicates patterns of bias in the models. However, the findings are based on specific scenarios, and the generalizability of these results to other contexts or conditions may be limited . -->

<!-- In summary, while the study provides valuable insights into krill population dynamics, these limitations highlight the need for further research and improved methodologies to enhance the accuracy and applicability of stock assessments in the context of ecosystem-based management. -->
