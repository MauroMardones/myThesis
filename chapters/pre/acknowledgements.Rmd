I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who were part of this long and meaningful journey. To my fellow PhD colleagues and the professors who generously shared their time and knowledge — thank you for your companionship, your insight, and your support along the way. To the amazing team at INACH, the Chilean Antarctic Institute (Francisco, Lucas y Lorena) — thank you for your openness and for sharing so many dimensions of Antarctic science and logistics. You helped me grasp the true complexity of the region I was trying to understand. To the Millennium Base Project, thank you for always considering me, even from afar. Your inclusion gave me a sense of belonging and motivation. I’m also grateful to the Program for Advanced Studies on High Latitudes at Universidad Austral de Chile for their continued encouragement and support. To the Instituto de Fomento Pesquero (IFOP), thank you for giving me the space to begin this journey. Your institutional support provided the foundation I needed to take the first steps. And to the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO), thank you for trusting in me and allowing me to complete this academic process in such a supportive environment. Your confidence in my work made all the difference. To my colleagues and friends — especially the Megacephalos crew — thank you for your irredeemably bad sense of humor (if we can call it that). Somehow, your jokes kept me grounded and smiling even on the hardest days.

And most of all, to my children — Ivian, Piero, and Rosario — thank you for loving me unconditionally, even when I was buried in krill models or distant in thought. You are my greatest source of strength, clarity, and perspective. I hope this journey becomes a small spark of inspiration for your own unfolding paths in life.

Finally, to my beloved wife María José, for whom no words are enough to describe her as a woman, a mother, a friend, and a life companion. I will always be grateful for your presence and unwavering support.

Thank you — all of you — for being part of this immense, sometimes chaotic, but always deeply rewarding process of learning and growth.
