Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) is a keystone species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and the target of one of the largest fisheries under CCAMLR regulation. Traditional assessment approaches have focused primarily on fishery-dependent data, often overlooking the role of environmental variability and predator dynamics in shaping krill population processes. In recent years, there has been a growing need to integrate the diverse pieces of information available for krill, which originate from multiple sources including fishery-dependent monitoring, scientific surveys, and ecosystem indicators such as predator behavior and environmental time series. This dissertation develops an ecosystem-informed stock assessment framework for krill in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Subarea 48.1), integrating physical and biological covariates into population models to improve realism and management relevance. First, the influence of environmental indicators on krill recruitment and somatic growth was evaluated. Model outputs indicate that recruitment is significantly correlated with both lagged sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (R2 = 0.27, p < 0.01) and spring chlorophyll-a concentrations (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.05), suggesting that early life stages of krill are sensitive to oceanographic conditions. Preliminary analyses also suggest that growth rates are modulated by spatial-temporal variability in food availability, although these relationships remain less statistically robust. An age-structured stock assessment model (SS3) was configured under the "areas as fleets" paradigm to capture spatial heterogeneity in fishing effort and krill productivity. Environmental covariates such as chlorophyll-a concentration were included as explanatory variables for recruitment and natural mortality, while penguin foraging activity was incorporated as a dynamic proxy for predation pressure. However, the inclusion of environmental and predator variables led to more biologically realistic models at the cost of reduced statistical performance, as reflected in higher model uncertainty and lower fit metrics (e.g., AIC increase of 5–8 units). This trade-off highlights the tension between model realism and statistical robustness, suggesting that ecosystem-informed models may offer greater explanatory power and management relevance, but require careful balancing against model simplicity and parsimony. In the final step, simulation-based management strategy evaluation (MSE) using a shortcut approach demonstrated that including these covariates in the operating model reduces bias in biomass estimates and improves the probability of maintaining spawning biomass above 75% B₀ over 10-year projections under precautionary harvest strategies. This work supports the implementation of adaptive, ecosystem-based management procedures for Antarctic krill, providing a replicable modeling framework that links population dynamics with environmental forcing and predator-prey interactions. It emphasizes the importance of embracing ecological complexity in stock assessment, especially under the challenges of climate-driven change in polar ecosystems. The ultimate goal of these modeling exercises is to raise the standard of krill stock assessments in support of science-based recommendations to CCAMLR, aligned with the ongoing development of a new krill fishery management strategy that incorporates ecosystem and spatial considerations.
