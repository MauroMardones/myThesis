To comprehensively understand dynamic population and fishery krill (*Euphausia superba*) and its ecosystem context in Wester Antarctic Peninsula, it is necessary to separate the process into at least four distinct components: biology and population complexity, spatiotemporal structure in dynamic population, environmental and ecosystem relationships, and the implications of the fishing industry on this organism. In this thesis, the following chapters address each of these dimensions, thereby providing greater certainty in contributing to scientific knowledge as well as to the sustainable management of its fishery.  [Chapter 1](#chap1) provides a comprehensive introduction to krill biology, ecosystem role, and the current state of knowledge regarding population dynamics in the WAP region. This foundation establishes the ecological and economic importance of krill while identifying critical knowledge gaps that limit effective management. [Chapter 2](#chap2) investigates the ecosystem drivers influencing krill population dynamics, examining how environmental variables including sea ice extent, ocean temperature, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and climate indices affect krill abundance and distribution patterns. This analysis reveals the complex and strong relationships between environmental forcing and population responses across temporal scales. [Chapter 3](#chap3) explores spatial heterogeneity in krill population dynamics throughout the WAP region, analyzing how local environmental conditions, oceanographic features, and habitat characteristics create distinct conditions signals of population status. This chapter identifies key areas of low potential reprodutive index and management recomendations. [Chapter 4](#chap4) presents a comprehensive stock assessment using an integrated length-to-age model approach, incorporating multiple data sources including fishery-independent surveys, commercial catch data, and ecosystems componentens. This modeling framework provides estimates of krill biomass, recruitment variability, and population trends while accounting for uncertainty in age determination and growth parameters. [Chapter 5](#chap5) conducts a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the krill fishery, testing the performance of different management procedures under various scenarios of environmental variability, recruitment and fishing pressure. This chapter evaluates the current and alternative harvest control rules and adaptive management strategies to identify robust approaches for sustainable krill fishery management in the face of uncertainty. [Chapter 6](#chap6) synthesizes findings from previous chapters to provide an integrated perspective on krill population dynamics and fishery sustainability. This discussion evaluates the implications of spatial and temporal variability for management strategies, assesses the performance of different modeling approaches, and provides recommendations for future research and management protocols. The thesis contributes to scientific understanding of krill population dynamics while providing practical tools for sustainable fishery management in the context of change and increasing intention of commercial exploitation along the Western Antarctic Peninsula.
