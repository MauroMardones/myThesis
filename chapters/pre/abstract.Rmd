This document presents a doctoral thesis focused on understanding the population dynamics of Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) and its associated fishery through a multidimensional approach. The main objective is to support decision-making processes by applying cutting-edge methodologies and scientific frameworks at the forefront of modern marine and fisheries science. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of krill population dynamics, fishing activity, and their ecosystem context in the Western Antarctic Peninsula, the thesis is structured around four interconnected components: the analysis of environmental and ecosystem relationships with krill populations; the characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of population dynamics; the integration of stock assessment processes using multiple data sources; and the evaluation of harvest control rules currently applied in krill fishery management. The following chapters address each of these dimensions.  [Chapter 1](#chap1) provides a comprehensive introduction to krill biology, ecosystem role, and the current state of knowledge regarding population dynamics and fishery in the WAP region. [Chapter 2](#chap2) investigates the ecosystem drivers influencing krill population dynamics, examining how environmental variables including sea ice extent, ocean temperature, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and climate indices affect krill abundance and distribution patterns. [Chapter 3](#chap3) explores spatial heterogeneity in krill population dynamics throughout the WAP region, analyzing how local environmental conditions and habitat characteristics create distinct conditions signals of population status in a spatial context. This chapter identifies key areas of low potential reprodutive index and management implications. [Chapter 4](#chap4) presents a comprehensive stock assessment using an integrated length-to-age model approach, incorporating multiple data sources including fishery-independent surveys, commercial catch data, and ecosystems components. This modeling framework provides estimates of krill biomass, recruitment variability, and population trends while accounting for uncertainty in different components, like, growth, selectivity,  parameters. [Chapter 5](#chap5) conducts a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the krill fishery wit a short cut approach, testing the performance of different management procedures under various scenarios of recruitment and fishing pressure. This chapter evaluates the current and alternative harvest control rules and adaptive management strategies to identify robust approaches for sustainable krill fishery management in the face of uncertainty. [Chapter 6](#chap6) synthesizes findings from previous chapters to provide an integrated perspective on krill population dynamics and fishery sustainability. This discussion evaluates the implications of spatial and temporal variability for management strategies, assesses the performance of different modeling approaches, and provides recommendations for future research and management protocols. This thesis advances scientific understanding of Antarctic krill population dynamics while offering practical tools for the development of sustainable fishery management strategies. It emphasizes the importance of integrating ecological considerations into decision-making processes, particularly in the fragile ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and, more specifically, along the Western Antarctic Peninsulaâ€”one of the most heavily impacted regions by anthropogenic harvesting pressure.
